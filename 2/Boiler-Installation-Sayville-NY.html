If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers.
