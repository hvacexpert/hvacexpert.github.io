The lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers.
