<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage. Since they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since an unit is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
