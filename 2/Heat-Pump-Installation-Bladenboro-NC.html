<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
