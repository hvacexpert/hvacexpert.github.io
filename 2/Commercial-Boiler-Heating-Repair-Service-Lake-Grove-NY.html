Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure materials, smoking cigarettes, household products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems.

<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating unit, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Generally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Consider possible impacts of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the maker's instructions, specifically directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
