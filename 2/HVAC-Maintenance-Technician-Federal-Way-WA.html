<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
