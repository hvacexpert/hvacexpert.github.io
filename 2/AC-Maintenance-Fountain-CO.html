This is typically utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  area and benefits from the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
