<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
