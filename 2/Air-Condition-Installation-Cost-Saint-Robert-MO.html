ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
