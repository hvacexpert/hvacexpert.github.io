These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate.

The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
