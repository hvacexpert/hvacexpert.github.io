<p>We look at ideas before we offer recommendations to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to supply enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
