<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the tools or skills needed to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are generally smaller sized than stick-built properties and utilize significantly less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat.

Remember that not as lots of brand names produce oil heating systems for this usage, and you may find more alternatives with natural gas, lp, or electric furnaces.<p>
