<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Amherst MA</h3>

We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
