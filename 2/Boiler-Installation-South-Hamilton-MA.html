<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A/c unit producers usually make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c stops working, begin by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers. Let the system cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers.
