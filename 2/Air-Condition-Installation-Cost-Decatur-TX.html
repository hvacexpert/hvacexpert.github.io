<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Decatur TX</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or replacing air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Both should be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle.
