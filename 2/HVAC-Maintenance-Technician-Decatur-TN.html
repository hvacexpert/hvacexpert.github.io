<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
