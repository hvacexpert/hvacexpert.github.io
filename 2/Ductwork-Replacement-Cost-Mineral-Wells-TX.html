<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not just filthy up the air, but lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpets and upholstery materials can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, talk with your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
