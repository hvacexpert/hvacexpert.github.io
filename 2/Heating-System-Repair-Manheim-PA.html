<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
