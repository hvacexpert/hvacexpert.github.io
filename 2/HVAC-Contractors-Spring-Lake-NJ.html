<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
