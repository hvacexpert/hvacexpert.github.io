<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>What to Look for When Selecting an Clifton TX HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
