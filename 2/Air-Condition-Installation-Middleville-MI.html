<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
