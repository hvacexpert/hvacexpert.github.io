<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Pagosa Springs CO?</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home building is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit.
