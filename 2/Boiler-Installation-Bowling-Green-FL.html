Depending on the kind of system set up, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're highly adverse dust. Furthermore, particular fuels and equipment may require special authorizations, and there is limited flexibility in case of changed heating requirements.

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had spotted the problem area in looking over the expense. He dealt with the issue in one day, had adjusted the bill to what I thought about reasonable before he recalled, knew what may have triggered the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not happen again. I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the objective of selling or spinning off a company eventually. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
