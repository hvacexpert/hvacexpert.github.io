<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.)
