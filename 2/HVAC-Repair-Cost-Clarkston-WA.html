<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
