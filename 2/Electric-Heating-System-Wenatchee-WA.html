The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power ought to not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level.
