<p>When our furnace was dying, we called two local companies for bids. While both were useful and handy, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a much better offer, for remarkable service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heater and located ways we might have more even heat. He consisted of these minor but significant modifications in his bid. Because of current warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons, we chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
