The EPA study prescribed and controlled methods utilized on a smaller sized number of houses.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space air conditioning provides optimum versatility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
