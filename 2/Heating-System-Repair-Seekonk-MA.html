<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
