<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities required to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician check the system occasionally.<p>
