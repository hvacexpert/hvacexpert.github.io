<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
