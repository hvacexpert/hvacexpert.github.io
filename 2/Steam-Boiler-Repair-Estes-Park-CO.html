<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioner back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
