<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
