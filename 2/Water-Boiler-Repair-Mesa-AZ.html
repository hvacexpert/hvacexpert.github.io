<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
