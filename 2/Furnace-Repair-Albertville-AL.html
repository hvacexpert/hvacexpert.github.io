<p>Many people underestimate the extent of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is typically envisioned as the black smoke produced from factories. Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, paints, and pesticides used in the home. To compound the issue, it is estimated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside, and more than half that time is invested in the home.<p>
<p>Most people do not understand that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break with time. That can compromise the efficiency of the system and ultimately harm it enough that you require to buy furnace replacement or AC replacement.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
