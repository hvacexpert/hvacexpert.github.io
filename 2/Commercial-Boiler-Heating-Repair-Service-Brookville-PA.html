Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
