<p>Chemical toxins: Unstable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; furniture, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Equipment costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency models will cost less, however lead to higher energy bills. High-efficiency designs cost more, but save more over the long run. Rates for gas furnaces vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs up to $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heating systems start at $395 and vary up to $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are generally smaller than stick-built residential or commercial properties and use substantially less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Expect the typical mobile house oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500.
