<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year.

<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
