<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
