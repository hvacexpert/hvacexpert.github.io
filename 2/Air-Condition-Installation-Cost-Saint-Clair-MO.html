<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
