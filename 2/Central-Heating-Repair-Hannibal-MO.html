<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
