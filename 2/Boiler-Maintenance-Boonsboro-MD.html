<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the service technicians believed they simply didn't seem right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same).

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
