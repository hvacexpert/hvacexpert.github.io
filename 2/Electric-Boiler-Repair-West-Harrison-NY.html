In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather.

The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
