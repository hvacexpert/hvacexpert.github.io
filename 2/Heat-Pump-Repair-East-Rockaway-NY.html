<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
