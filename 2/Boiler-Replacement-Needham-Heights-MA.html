I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
