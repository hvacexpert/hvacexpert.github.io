<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, these days. While many people presume contamination is just an outdoor problem, your house (and workplace) can also be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we do not believe sufficient about exposure to all the important things we put in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- immediately, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them..

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
