They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; wall, furnishings and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health effects discussed.
