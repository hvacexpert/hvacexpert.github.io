<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>Air conditioning and refrigeration are supplied through the removal of heat. Heat can be eliminated through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as refrigerants A refrigerant is employed either in a heatpump system in which a compressor is used to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a free cooling system which utilizes pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (generally water or a glycol mix).<p>
<p>If you have a large home, a home with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a house with insufficient insulation, heating your floorings rather than the air might not suffice to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.
