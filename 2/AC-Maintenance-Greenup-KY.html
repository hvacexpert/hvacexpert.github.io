<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
