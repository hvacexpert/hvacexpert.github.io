<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation.

While a space heater is in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the rest of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
