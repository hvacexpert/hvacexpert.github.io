<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final floor surface. This is typically utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  location and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
