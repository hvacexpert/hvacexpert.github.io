<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops ought to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly option, but more recent systems can be very energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems usually achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely effective natural gas heaters can attain AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
