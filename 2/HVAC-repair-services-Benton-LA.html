<p>You may decide to keep your service and product line simple for now if you're in the first couple of years of organisation.

<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a home can be heated up in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found just a few feet below ground.
