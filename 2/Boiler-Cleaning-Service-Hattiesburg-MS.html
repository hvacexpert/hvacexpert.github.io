<p>Expert heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC experts recommend following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
