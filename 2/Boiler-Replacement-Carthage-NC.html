Since they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since an unit is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
