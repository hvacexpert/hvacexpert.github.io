<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be residing in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system.

<p>More common in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual rooms.
