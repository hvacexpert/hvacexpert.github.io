What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
