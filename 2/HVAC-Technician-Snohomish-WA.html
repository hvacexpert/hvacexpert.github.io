<p>Contaminants such as cooking smells, family pet dander, mold, cigarette smoke, and chemical doors might affect indoor air quality and harmful health results may be developed that can endanger locals. If members of your household are experiencing specific symptoms such as frequent allergic reactions, cold or other breathing concerns in your home, then it's time for these to be addressed and for your home's indoor air quality to be improved.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the living space.<p>
