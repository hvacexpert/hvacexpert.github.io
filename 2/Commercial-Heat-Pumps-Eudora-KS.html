<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace at Eudora KS</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
