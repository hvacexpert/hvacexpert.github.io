<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
