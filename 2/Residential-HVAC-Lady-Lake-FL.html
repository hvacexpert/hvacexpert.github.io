<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air path. A standard air conditioning unit transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
