<p>Resideo provides a range of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System services for both brand-new building and retrofit applications. Breathing air toxins can result in asthmatic and allergic responses, infections and other health issue that include the lungs, nose and throat. For example, pet cats, caged birds and rodents, and pets can produce dander and other particles that can trigger allergic reactions or asthma symptoms in some people. Pre-owned smoke is also harmful to people, particularly children.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>As with homes, the most essential element influencing indoor air quality is the existence of contaminant sources.

<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can collect and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these diseases do not show up until many years after exposure began. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some industrialized illness from direct exposure to clothing and equipment brought home from task websites.<p>

<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by serving as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
