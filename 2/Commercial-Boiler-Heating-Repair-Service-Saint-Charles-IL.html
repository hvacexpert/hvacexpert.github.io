Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them again. Switch off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
