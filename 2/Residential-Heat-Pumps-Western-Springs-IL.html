<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become blocked with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air might likewise be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area.<p>
<p>Many indoor air contaminants originate from the cooking area. Gas stoves release hazardous impurities, including carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. Even electric burners produce those exact same contaminants in lower levels, along with other particles that can be quickly taken in into your bloodstream. So, when you're cooking, make certain to turn on your kitchen vents, or open a window to help filter out the air a lot more.<p>
