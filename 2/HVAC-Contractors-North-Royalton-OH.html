<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

The collectors, piping and tank must be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed periodically to remove tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems need to be examined a minimum of twice each year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to get rid of dust collected in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
