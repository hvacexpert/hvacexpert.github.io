Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, an expert service person ought to be required almost any maintenance other than routine cleaning.
