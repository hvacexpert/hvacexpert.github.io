<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, as well as all other kinds of heatpump, have actually effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE. It's a scientific way of identifying just how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. The majority of geothermal heat pump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0. This suggests for every single system of energy used to power the system, 3 to 5 units are provided as heat.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
