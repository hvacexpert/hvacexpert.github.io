<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on one of the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to assess situation & chose to choose them for the work.

<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
