<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
