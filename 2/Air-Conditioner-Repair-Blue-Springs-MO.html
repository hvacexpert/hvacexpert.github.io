<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Blue Springs MO</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, floors, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
