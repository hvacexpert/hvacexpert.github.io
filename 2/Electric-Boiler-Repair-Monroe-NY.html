<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
