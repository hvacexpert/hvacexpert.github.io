<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons.
