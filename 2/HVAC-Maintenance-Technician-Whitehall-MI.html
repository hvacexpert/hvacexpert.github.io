<p>A specific air conditioner that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air course. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside.
