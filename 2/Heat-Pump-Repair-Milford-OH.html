<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis.
