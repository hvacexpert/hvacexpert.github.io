Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure products, smoking, household items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating systems.

<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Place control includes moving the toxin source far from residents or perhaps transferring prone occupants.<p>
<p>When installing radiant heating, you ought to give serious thought to the kind of flooring covering in the home. Ceramic tile works well because it carries out and shops heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work fairly well. Carpeting will directly insulate the floor from the space, decreasing effectiveness, so if you wish to install carpet in a radiant-heated space, use a thin carpet with dense cushioning.<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
