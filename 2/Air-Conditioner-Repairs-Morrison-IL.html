<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, given that it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>

On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
