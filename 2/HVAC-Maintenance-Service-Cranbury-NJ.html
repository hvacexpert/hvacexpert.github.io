<h3>How to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews in Cranbury NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
