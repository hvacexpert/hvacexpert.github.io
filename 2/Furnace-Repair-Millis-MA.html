<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>There are 2 primary kinds of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are required to withstand present, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great location to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
