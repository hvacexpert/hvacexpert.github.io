<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>
<h3>Central Heating Systems in Clinton Ohio</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
