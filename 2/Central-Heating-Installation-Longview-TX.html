<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, particularly if you live in a place that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air.

To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
