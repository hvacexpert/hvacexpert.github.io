<h3>Ventilation System in Los Altos CA 94024</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
