Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical energy. The 2 operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
