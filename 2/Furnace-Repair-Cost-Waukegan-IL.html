<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
