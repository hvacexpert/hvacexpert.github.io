<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, given that the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level.

The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
