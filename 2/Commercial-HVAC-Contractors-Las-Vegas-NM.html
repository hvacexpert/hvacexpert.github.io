<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
