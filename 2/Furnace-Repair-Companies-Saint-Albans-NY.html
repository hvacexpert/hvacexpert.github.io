<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might activate attacks in people with asthma. There is proof that some individuals can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually also been shown to cause cancer in animals and may trigger cancer in people.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
