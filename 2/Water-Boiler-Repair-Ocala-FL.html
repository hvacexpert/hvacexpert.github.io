<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations build up inside, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
