<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
