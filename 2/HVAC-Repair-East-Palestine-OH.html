Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same period. Essentially, SEER provides more information based on how the EER performs in different temps. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>
