<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
