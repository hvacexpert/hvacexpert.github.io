Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally humid climates or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity.

A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
