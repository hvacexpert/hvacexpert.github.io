On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having solved the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part.

<p>The very first a/c and fridges used toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
