<p>Compounding the noted health symptoms might be task tension. In part, due to various elements of office automation, the most stressful elements of office work are increasing. Health signs related to task tension consist of mental and physical strains such as frustration, anxiety, irritability, anger, depression, stomach or gastro-intestinal disturbances, and muscle and mental stress. These symptoms may be promoted by poor indoor quality.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
