<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
