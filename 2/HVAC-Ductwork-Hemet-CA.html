<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power should not go beyond the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, since the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Basically, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

Second of all, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
