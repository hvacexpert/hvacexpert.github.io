<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
