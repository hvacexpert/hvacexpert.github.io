In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.
