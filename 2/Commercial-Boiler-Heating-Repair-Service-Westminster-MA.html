<p>Information offered in this safety guide is based on present clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your home's systems. The "life expectancy" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to 20 years. Makers normally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>The first a/c unit and fridges used hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
