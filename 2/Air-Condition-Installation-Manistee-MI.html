<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
