<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal convenience inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
