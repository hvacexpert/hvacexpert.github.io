<p>Similar to the majority of house improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heating system can differ commonly based on the size of the house. Many heating systems will last between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by many public water products, it has been discovered in well water. If you've tested the air in your house and found a radon issue, and you have a well, contact a lab accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are normally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also appear not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
