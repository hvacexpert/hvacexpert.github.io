<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Preston ID?</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely happy that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system before you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
