<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
