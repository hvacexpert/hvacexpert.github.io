<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
