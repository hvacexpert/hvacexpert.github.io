CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources.

<p>Particular immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently challenging to identify if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is essential to focus on the time and place the signs occur. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the humidity, cooling, or heating conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts however the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
