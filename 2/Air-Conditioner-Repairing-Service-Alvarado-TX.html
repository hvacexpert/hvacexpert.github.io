<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>

Kids might have greater direct exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
