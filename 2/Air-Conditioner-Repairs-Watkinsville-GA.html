<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
