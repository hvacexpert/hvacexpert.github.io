<p>In general, ductless AC systems are more energy-efficient and eco-friendly than traditional A/cs. Since you can turn off private spaces when you're not occupying them, this is.

<p>If you're looking for an honest, hard-working, incredibly trustworthy, & knowledgeable cooling & heating contractor - give Around the Clock a call! When I moved in 5+ years ago, I was originally referred to Ilan & his group by several of my neighbors. I have them carry out an annual tune-up & the a number of times I require a service call, Ilan was able always able to fit me in the same day. They're excellent with the communications - phone, text, email! I place allot of value on a small company owner who resides in the neighborhood he services.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
