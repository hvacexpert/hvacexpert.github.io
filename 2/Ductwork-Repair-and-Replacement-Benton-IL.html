<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>For instance, contaminants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing toxins into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption lies near a source of wetness or other outdoor contaminant, it may work as a path to bring the pollutants inside.
