<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Highlands TX</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of changing or exchanging air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and extreme moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
