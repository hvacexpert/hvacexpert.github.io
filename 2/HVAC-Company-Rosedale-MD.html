<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Rosedale MD</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>When every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system visually inspected at least. This evaluation is an important element of HVAC maintenance. If you don't get your system checked, you won't discover a problem until it quits working in the middle of winter season. Since you will have to hunt for alternative heating sources up until the system is fixed, that's the last thing you desire. Routine assessment and maintenance also helps keep it in great shape and lengthens its life.<p>
