<p>There is no easy response, however many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better solution.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
