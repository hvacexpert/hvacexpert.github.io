Such a tool needs to identify the variety of individuals affected; define ages and job descriptions of involved employees; determine where they are located within the workplace; indicate when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of particular health symptoms or illnesses; identify all devices run in the office; indicate the kind of outside air contamination; and determine potential sources of task tension.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the outcome of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow. Workplace temperatures need to be preserved between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air flow should be avoided.<p>

Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
