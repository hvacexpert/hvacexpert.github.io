<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
