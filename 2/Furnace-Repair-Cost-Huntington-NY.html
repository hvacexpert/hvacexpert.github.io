<p>All heating systems have some level of air purification. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may pick to change the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system.

However, considering recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it may be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>
