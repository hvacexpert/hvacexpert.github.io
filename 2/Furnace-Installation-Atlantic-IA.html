<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
