<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
