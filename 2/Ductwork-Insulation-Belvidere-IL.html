<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry. Also, if the air conditioner smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat far from your home.

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the inspection on a very cold day they killed the furnace declaring health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new property owner I have discovered how to determine the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe simply as essential when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
