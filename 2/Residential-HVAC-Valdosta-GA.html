<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>

CARB likewise performs and sponsors research study into all elements of indoor air quality, with a focus on figuring out levels of direct exposure to damaging indoor air pollutants, and seeking methods to prevent and decrease that direct exposure.<p>
