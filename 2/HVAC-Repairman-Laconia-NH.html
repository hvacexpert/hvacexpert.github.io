<p>Sean was really valuable. He is an extremely pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
