<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house.

Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service strategy which usually consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the US your house is located, the local area's environment can change considerably. A house situated in the South would require an AC system with a size capable of cooling your home due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would require a much bigger heating capability also which will impact expenses. See the chart listed below for the average central air conditioner replacement expenses by LOTS.<p>
