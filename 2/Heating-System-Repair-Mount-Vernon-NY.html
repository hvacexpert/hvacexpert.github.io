<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated efficiency benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since a system is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
