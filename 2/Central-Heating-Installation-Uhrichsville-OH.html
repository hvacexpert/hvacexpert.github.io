<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c unit and heatpump should be without all blockages and particles. Blockages can block the flow of condensed water and trigger moisture accumulation within the system. Excess moisture can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, irregular temperature level policy, germs, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess wetness streams away from the system.<p>
