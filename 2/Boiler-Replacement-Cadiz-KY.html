<p>All Points Heating uses home cooling, air conditioning unit installation, a/c unit maintenance that provide trustworthy, proven efficiency at high effectiveness.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
