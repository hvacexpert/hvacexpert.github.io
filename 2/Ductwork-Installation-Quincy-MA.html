<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
