<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is wintry. Also, if the a/c unit smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Plenty of HVAC companies will price out things like specialized filter changes throughout Preventative Maintenance visits, individually, as an add on service for you.

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan must spin.

Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you have actually offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
