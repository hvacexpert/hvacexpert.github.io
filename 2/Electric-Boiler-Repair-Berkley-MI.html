<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
