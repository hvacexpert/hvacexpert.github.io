<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>In addition, house owners have a range of choices to choose from in powering a flooring heating unit. Radiant systems work with electrical, gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As lots of house owners are all too aware, legacy furnace systems are usually limited to working on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the market for that energy source turns unpredictable, rates can fluctuate, costs surge and you can wind up paying more to heat your house no matter how low you set your thermostat.<p>

<p>Examine these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
