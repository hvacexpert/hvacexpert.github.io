<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
