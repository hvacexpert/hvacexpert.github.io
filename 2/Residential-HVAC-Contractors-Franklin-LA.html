<p>Though it might be hard to think, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Transmittable diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health problems caused by biological contaminants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and gastrointestinal problems.<p>
