<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

I extremely highly advise the two gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and appreciation for a job well done.<p>
