<p>There are 2 main types of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating service. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to withstand current, which then generates heat.<p>
