<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those measurements on hand when looking for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window. Also, keep fire security in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioner: Do not place it in an egress window that serves as the only methods of escape need to a fire appear.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, the majority of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
