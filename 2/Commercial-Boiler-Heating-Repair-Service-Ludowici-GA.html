<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
