Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent possibility; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen.
