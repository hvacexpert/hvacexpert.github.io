<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>
