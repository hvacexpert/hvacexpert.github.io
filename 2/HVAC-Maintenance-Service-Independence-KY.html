<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Independence KY HVAC Company</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the a/c before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
