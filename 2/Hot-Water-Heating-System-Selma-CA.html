A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
