Jeremiah Bartula the plumber discussed our alternatives prior to our deal with Brian and was incredible, informative and helpful - his work was impeccable!

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while explaining everything to me.
