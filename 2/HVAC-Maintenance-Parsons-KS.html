<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
