<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
