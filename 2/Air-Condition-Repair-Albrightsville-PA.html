<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
