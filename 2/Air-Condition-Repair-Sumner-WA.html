We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater.

We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
