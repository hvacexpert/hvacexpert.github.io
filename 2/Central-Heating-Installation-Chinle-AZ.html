<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Chinle AZ</h3>
<p>Spot Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans should be installed in all restrooms and kitchens. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are durable and quiet. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to guarantee the fans run for a sufficient time period. An excellent guideline is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
