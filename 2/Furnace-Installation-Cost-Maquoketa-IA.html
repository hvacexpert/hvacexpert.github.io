<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills suddenly seem greater than regular, it is probably time to consider a new system. New heating equipment is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel costs immediately, not to discuss the money you'll minimize repair costs. If your heater is 25 years of ages or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same period. Basically, SEER supplies more information based upon how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The higher the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
