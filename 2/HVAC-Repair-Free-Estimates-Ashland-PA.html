<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter season can intensify issues. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is necessary to be familiar with some of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that might be prowling in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
