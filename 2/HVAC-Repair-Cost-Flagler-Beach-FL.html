<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
