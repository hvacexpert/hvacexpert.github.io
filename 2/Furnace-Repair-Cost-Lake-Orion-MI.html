<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the house.

An air contaminant might likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care products.

Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same).

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
