<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance in North Versailles Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>The reality is, air pollution in your home can be simply as bad - and even worse - than it is outdoors.

<p>Radiant heating involves installing coils or pipelines in the flooring, providing heat from below and moving upward. It provides an even, overall heat temperature level throughout the space. Without any moving parts, it's really quiet and comfy, and it doesn't stimulate as much dust and irritants, as compared to forced-air systems. It also does not produce any drafts, and removing the requirement to blow air makes it more energy effective.<p>
<p>Because they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
