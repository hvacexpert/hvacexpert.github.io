As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
