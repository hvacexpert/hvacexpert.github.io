<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
