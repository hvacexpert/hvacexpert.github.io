<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
