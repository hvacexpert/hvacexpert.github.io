From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated.
