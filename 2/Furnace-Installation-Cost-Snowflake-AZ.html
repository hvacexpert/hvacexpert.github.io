<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
