<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
