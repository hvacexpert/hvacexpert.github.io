The lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
