<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.
