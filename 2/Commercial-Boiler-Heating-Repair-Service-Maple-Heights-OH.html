The product was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with concerns. I would recommend this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.
