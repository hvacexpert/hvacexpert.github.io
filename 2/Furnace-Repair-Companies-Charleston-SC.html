<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually enjoyed the single-family house installation organisation completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months.

<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the ac system?

Too big and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c will not have the ability to cool the house properly.

<p>The predominant health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
