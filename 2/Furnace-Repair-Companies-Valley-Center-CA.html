<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure.

<h3>Facts All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Valley Center CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
