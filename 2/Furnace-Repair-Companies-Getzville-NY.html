<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles.

On those days when you simply can't seem to warm up and find you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not prone to this issue due to the fact that they heat surface areas and not the air itself. Additionally, since they do not rely upon fans, ducts, returns and registers to disperse hot air, in-floor heating systems can minimize the amount of dust and seasonal irritants in your house.<p>
