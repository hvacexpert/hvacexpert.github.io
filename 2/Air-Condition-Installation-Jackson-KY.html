<h3>Truth About Jackson KY Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being far more extreme with lower outside temperatures, so heatpump are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
