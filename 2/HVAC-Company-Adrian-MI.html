Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and air conditioning company.
