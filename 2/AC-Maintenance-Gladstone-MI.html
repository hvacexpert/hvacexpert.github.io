<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC.
