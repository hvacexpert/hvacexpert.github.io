<p>Among the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly pricey to install, particularly in an older home. Depending on the kind of unit installed, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're extremely adverse dust.

During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy.

Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
