Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
