<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>

After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
