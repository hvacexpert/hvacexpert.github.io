<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>A third method to choose whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can suggest your house may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To discover odors in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
