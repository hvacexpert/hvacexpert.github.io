<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A split ac system consists of two main parts - a compressor situated outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split air conditioners depend on a set of pipes to connect the outside to the inside air unit which is why there are referred to as a ductless mini-split air conditioner installation Refrigerant is dispersed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to generate either heated or cold air.<p>
