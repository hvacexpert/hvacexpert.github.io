They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of allowing heat to warm up the concrete piece listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
