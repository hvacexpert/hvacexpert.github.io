<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
