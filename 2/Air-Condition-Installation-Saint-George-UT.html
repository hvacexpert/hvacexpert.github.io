<p>Structures are developed or planned to react actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and keep surface areas to improve their look, durability, or performance. In other cases, such modifications subtly or perhaps considerably modify structures in ways that might be important to their own stability or their effect on structure residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, particularly, a few of the techniques used by scientists studying environments, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
