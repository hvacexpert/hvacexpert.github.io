<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units include not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity.
