<p>A regular furnace tune up can maximize effectiveness and provide longer enduring house heating. However, there are times when a basic maintenance call can identify a concern that will require a significant financial investment to treat. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the pricey repair and take pleasure in ongoing comfort from your existing heating system? Or, do you make an even larger monetary commitment to changing the furnace? The decision to change or repair is up to you, and often it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into consideration the age of the devices, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely offers greater energy performance and includes warranty protection.<p>
