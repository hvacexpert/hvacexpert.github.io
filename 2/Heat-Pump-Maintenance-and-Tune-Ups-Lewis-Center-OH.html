<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Lewis Center Ohio</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing. Your heating technician can install controls which instantly closed down the heatpump if temperatures reach and drop listed below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>We have been very happy with Stability's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has worked extremely well and is so effective that it considerably minimized our utility expenditures - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we have needed them for emergency situations they responded rapidly and fixed the issue.<p>
