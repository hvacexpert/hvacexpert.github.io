<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
