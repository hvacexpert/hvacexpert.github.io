<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Prospect CT HVAC Company</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
