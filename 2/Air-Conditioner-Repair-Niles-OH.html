<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated performance benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because an unit is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
