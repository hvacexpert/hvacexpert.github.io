<h3>Facts All Clyde NC Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. Many house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
