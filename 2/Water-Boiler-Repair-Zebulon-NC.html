<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
