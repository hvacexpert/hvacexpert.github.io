<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
