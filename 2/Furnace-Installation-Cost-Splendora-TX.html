<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

<p>Prior to cooling or setting up any new heating system in a house, it is required to re examine and decrease the energy load of the home. A more energy efficient home will not only reduce the cost of a brand-new system and utility expenses, however it will greatly improve the comfort of your home. Before we style and set up any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Standard enhancements generally consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise a number of competent house Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>
