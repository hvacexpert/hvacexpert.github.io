<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
