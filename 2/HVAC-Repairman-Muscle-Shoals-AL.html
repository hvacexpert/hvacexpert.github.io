<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
