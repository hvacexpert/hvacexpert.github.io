Because they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
