<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Important Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can mean considerable savings in annual heating costs.

Because they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
