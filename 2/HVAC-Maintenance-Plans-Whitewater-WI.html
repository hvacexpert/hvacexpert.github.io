<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts.

As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
