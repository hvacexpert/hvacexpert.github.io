A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear.

If the exhaust outlets are clogged, they can cause a hazardous accumulation and jeopardize your security.

<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and treat-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
