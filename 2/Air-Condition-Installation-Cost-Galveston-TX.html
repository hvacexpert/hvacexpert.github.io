<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
