<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become an essential problem to property owners and health professionals.

Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these pollutants are essential in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c are more energy efficient than models made 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's five years old or older.
