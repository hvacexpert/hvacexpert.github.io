Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
