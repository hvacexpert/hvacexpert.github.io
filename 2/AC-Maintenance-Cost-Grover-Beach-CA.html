The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
