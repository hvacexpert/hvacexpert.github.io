It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>To start, it's a good idea to consider energy performance. By choosing a central AC system that has as high of a performance rating as possible, you can lower your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run.

For example, human beings exhale co2, which in little amounts is not poisonous, however might become dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms might likewise be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread throughout the entire office or structure by means of the ventilation system.<p>
