<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
