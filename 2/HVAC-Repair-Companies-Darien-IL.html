<p>Only a professional can precisely detect why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems odd or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call an expert.

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you have to do it often, it's most likely time for an expert opinion.<p>
