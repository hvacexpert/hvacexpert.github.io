It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
