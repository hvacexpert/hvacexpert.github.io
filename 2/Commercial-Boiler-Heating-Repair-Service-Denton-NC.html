<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working, integrity Energy was quick to respond. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heaters can heat your home. Honestly, our house heating system is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
