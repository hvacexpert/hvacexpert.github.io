<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a continuous temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER).

Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
