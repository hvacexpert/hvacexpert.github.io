<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
