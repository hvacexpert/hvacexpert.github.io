<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years before that.<p>
