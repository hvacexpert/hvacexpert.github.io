For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy.
