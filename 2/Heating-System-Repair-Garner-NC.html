<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
