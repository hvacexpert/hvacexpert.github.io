<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
