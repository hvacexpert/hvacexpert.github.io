<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
