<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person need to be called for practically any maintenance besides routine cleaning. Central air conditioners should be professionally examined and adjusted before the beginning of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup. While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>

<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a basic air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, given that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
