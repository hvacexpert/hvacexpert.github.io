<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Yucca Valley California</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences produced by these forces move air-borne toxins from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
