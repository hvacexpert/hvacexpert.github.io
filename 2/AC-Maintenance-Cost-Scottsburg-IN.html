<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a referral later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
