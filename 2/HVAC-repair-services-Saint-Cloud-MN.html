<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house.

Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it via software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>

<p>The bureau tasks 34 percent work growth for HVAC technicians in between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all professions.

<p>A third method to choose whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
