<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be successfully recognized or corrected without a comprehensive structure examination.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
