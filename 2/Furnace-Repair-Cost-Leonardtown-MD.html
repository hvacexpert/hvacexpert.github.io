It has also been shown to trigger cancer in animals and may cause cancer in humans.<p>

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>In some cases a short-lived indoor air quality issue is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more intricate concerns-- determined by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 techniques below might be proper.<p>
