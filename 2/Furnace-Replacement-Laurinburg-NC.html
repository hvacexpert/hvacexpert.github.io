<p>The first a/c unit and fridges employed flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every three months. Throughout high use months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
