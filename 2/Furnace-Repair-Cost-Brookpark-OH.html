<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Brookpark OH 44142</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
