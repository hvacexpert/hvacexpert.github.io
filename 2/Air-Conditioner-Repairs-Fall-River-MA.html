On those days when you just can't appear to warm up and discover you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating.

Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
