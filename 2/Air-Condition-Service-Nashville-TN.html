<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't use agreements.  The so called reliable companies dupe more people than the fly by night outfits.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>

For instance, homeowners may wish to look for one that comes with an integrated filter light that will alert you when the air filter requires to be changed.
