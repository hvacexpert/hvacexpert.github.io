Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family house installation business entirely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living.

<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
