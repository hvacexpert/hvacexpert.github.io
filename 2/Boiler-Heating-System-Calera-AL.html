Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent possibility; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual occasions.<p>
