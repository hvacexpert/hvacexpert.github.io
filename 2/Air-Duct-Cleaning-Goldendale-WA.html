As a result your oil or gas furnace may run longer to offer the very same amount of heat. This will cause your energy bills to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies every month might be used to help you pay for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating costs from the previous years. If there is a considerable distinction, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
