<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
