<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and workplaces matters, particularly given that we spend the majority of our lives indoors. A/c unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioner is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it might just require to be cleaned up. Whether or not this is the reason for the issue, it's an excellent early remedy to attempt. Strategy to do this on a relatively warm day.

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
