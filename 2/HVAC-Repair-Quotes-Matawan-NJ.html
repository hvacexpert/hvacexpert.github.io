For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
