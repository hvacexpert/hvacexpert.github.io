<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Often there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities exist will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
