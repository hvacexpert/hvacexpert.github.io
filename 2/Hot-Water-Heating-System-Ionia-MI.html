<p>These guys have been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I sometimes need contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost. Just recently I needed to contact these people twice. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work.

Underground temperature stays consistent no matter the climate, so geothermal systems supply constant and trustworthy cooling and heating.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
