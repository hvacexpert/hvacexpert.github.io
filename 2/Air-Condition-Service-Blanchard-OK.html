<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Lots of typical building materials utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation.
