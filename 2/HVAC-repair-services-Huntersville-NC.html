<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
