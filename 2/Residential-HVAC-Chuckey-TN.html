<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) refers to less frequent (however frequently more severe) cases of people ending up being ill after being in a particular structure at a certain time. In these cases, there is usually a comparable set of scientific symptoms experienced by the people and a clear cause can typically be discovered upon investigation. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI brought on by bacteria which can contaminate a building's a/c system.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Some health impacts can be beneficial indicators of an indoor air quality problem, especially if they appear after an individual moves to a new home, remodels or refurnishes a home, or treats a home with pesticides.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales male comes to your house he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the alternatives for your requirements and you choose if you require it.<p>

<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
