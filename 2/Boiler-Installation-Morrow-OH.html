<p>Info supplied in this security guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The requirements do not require you to change your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services must still be offered for your home's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to 20 years. Producers typically continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard enters into effect.<p>

At the same time, however, you want your heating system to be as environmentally friendly and effective as possible to keep your costs down and your home warm.<p>

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
