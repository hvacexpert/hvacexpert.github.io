<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not just dirty up the air, but cause other health problems.

Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
