<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
