<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Bear DE</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
