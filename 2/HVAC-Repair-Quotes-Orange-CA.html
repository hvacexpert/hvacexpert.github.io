<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health problems triggered by biological contaminants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
