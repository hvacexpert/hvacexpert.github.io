<p>A health questionnaire must be developed and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool needs to identify the number of individuals impacted; define ages and task descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they lie within the office; indicate when the symptoms take place (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of particular health signs or diseases; determine all devices operated in the office; show the kind of outdoors air pollution; and recognize potential sources of job stress.<p>
