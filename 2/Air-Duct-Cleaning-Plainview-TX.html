<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

Additionally, the ground source heatpump is very durable and can last you for many years with simply an extremely little amount of maintenance, a huge difference to the considerable maintenance a more traditional system needs. The geothermal ground loop is also long-lasting if a geothermal heat pump is properly set up.

<p>Our indoor air quality experts can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.

The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems also help manage germs and natural odors. The majority of store-bought filters can not eliminate these tiniest of irritants and do not eliminate bacteria and gases.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
