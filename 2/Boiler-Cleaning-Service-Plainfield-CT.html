<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Plainfield CT</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
