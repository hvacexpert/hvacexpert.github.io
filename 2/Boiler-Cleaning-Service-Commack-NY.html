<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works at Commack NY?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future.

<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
