Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

Direct exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being caught in buildings and concentrations build up inside your home.<p>
