<p>We look at hints before we supply guidance to replace instead of repair a heating system. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
