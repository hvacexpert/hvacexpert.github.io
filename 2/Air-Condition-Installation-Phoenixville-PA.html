<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They advised changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
