<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it considers not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
