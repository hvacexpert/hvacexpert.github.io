<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate.
