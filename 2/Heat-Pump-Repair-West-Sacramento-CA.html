<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Children might have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
