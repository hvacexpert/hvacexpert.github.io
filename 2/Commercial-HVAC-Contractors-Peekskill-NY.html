<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. Squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler normally occur when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is poorly aligned or worn and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>

<h3>AC Repair Cost in Peekskill NY 10566</h3>
<p>It's a reality that a new furnace for your home is one of the more significant costs involved in own a home. However, it should likewise be seen as a long-term financial investment.

<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they identified the issue and repaired really rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
