<p>There are many reasons this can occur. The bright side is that you can deal with a number of these aspects on your own without the requirement to require expert help. Start by opening the heat registers and then carry on to examining the thermostat settings. Next, examine the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover. You can also inspect the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and examine the standing pilot burner to make certain it is lit.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
