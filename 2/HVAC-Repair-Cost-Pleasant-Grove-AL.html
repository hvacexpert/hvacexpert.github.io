<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Pleasant Grove AL</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
