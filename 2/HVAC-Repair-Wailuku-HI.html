<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of furnaces have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t correctly diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
