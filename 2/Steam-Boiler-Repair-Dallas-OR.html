What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
