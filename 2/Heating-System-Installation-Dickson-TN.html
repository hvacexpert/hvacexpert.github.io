<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Professionals advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
