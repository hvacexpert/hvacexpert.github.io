<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space.
