Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
