<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
