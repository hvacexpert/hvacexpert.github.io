The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank must be checked for leakages, the system should be flushed occasionally to remove tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas).

<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators.

Convected heat offers heat from the floor up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same.

Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and harden-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
