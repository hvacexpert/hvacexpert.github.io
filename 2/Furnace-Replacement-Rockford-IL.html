<p>The function of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and constructing security at affordable energy expenses. Load determining is referred to as the Manual J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, identifying the proper size of unit for your home likewise depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
