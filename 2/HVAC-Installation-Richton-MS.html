<p>Buildings are developed or planned to respond actively to some of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and keep surfaces to improve their appearance, efficiency, or longevity. In other cases, such modifications subtly or perhaps dramatically modify buildings in ways that may be necessary to their own stability or their effect on structure residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We might find it beneficial to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, some of the methods used by researchers studying communities, in order to acquire an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
