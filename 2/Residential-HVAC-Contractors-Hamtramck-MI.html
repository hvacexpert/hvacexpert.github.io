<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. Many home heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house.

Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
