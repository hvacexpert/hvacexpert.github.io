<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can stay and build up in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these diseases do disappoint up till several years after exposure started. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the task; some developed disease from exposure to clothing and equipment brought house from task websites.<p>

<p>Consumer products which contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can trigger symptoms related to exposure to carbon monoxide. Thoroughly check out the labels containing health threat info and warns on the proper usage of these products. When possible; usage indoors just if the area is well ventilated, use products that include methylene chloride outdoors.<p>
<p>Airborne irritants are simply a reality of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergy symptoms, and sometimes, trigger asthma attacks. Infections, bacteria, and germs also can reside in the air you breathe every day. These airborne contaminants can impact your home comfort equipment, too. Allowed to circulate through your house and your system, these and other particles can build up on the indoor coil, preventing air flow and lowering heating and cooling effectiveness. By utilizing the products and services we offer, you can decrease and often get rid of these undesirable airborne toxins from your house, leaving tidy air and safe surfaces throughout your home.<p>
<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
