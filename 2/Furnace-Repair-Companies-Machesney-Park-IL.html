<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my requirements completely by providing an expert quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the essential assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
