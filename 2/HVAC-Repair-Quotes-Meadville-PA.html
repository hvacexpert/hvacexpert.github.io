Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
