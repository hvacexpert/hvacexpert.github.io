Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.

The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
