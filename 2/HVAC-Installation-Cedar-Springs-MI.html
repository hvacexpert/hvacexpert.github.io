The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
