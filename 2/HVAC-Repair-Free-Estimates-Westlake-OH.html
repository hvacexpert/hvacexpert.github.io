<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health effects pointed out. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the house. Oftentimes, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed effects could take place.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
