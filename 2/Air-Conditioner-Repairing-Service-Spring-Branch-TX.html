<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>Truth All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Spring Branch TX</h3>

After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance.

In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
