<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company in Holly MI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
