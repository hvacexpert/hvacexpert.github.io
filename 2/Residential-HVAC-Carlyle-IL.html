<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and work environments matters, especially considering that we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, electrical power or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
