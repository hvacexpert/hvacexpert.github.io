<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
