<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.
