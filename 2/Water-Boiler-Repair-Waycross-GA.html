<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
