If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized.
