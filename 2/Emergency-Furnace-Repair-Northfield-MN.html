Or, as an option, think about utilizing strong wood items. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being wet.<p>
