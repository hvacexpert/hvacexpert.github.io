<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
