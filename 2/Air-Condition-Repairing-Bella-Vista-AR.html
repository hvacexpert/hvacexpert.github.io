Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling effect.
