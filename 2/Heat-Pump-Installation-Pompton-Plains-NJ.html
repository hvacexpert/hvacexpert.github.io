We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the ac system before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
