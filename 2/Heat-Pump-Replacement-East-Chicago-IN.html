<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are offered to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Support! Climate Pro is trustworthy and truly cared about us and our situation. We got back one night to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated house once again. What's most remarkable was that this all taken place during Thanksgiving week!

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
