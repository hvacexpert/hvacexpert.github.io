Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
