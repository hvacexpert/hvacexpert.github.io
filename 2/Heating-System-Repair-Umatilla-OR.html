The most effective fans are peaceful and resilient. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to guarantee the fans run for a sufficient amount of time. A great general rule is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned from the furnace routinely.
