Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Many aspects impact IAQ. These factors consist of bad ventilation (lack of outdoors air), issues managing temperature level, high or low humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air coming into the building.
