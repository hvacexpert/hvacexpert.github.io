<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>Homes can have the same indoor air problems as single-family homes because a lot of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials, home furnishings, and household items, are comparable.

<p>Outdoor impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and generally are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
