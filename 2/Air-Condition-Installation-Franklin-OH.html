<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in location. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often tough to measure, as one action stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented.

For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  an extremely beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
