<p>My oldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
