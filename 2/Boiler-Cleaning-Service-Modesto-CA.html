<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
