<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
