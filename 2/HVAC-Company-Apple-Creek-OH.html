<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
