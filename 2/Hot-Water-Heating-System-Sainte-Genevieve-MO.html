<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Such info can in some cases be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative ought to ask for that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring data might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
