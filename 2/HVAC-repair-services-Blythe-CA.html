<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
