<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can often be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping track of data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must request that the company have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
