And with the typical American costs 87% of their life inside, you 'd think that indoor air quality would be something we 'd become aware of more often. But don't panic! With a little preventative maintenance and some fundamental knowledge, you can take immediate actions to enhance your indoor air quality today.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality specialists can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.

This is an extremely common repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having actually other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance due to the fact that the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
