<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
