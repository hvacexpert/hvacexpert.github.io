<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
