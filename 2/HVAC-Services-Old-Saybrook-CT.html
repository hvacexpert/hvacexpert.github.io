<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
