<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Whiteland IN</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality concerns. In the absence of such legislation, the "general responsibility provision" uses. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer needs to provide a healthy and safe work environment. Thus, ensuring the air is of good quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
