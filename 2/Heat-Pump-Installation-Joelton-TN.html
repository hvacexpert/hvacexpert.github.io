<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Joelton TN</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>
