<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
