<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
