<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them..

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair.
