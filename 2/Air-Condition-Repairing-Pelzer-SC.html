<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure.

<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
