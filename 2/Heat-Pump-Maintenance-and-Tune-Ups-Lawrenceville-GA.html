<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits.
