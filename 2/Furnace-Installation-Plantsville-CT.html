<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
