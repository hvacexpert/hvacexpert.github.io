<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
