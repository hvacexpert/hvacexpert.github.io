<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
