They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>We look at clues prior to we supply recommendations to change rather than repair a heater. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently.
