<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
