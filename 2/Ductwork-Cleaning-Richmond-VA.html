<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
