Just as with switches, someone may have switched off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a deal with that's perpendicular to the gas pipeline, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends on how old your furnace is. You may have a pilot light if you have an old furnace or boiler.

In turn, the items in the space, like furniture and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
