That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up simply a few years earlier.<p>
