All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it.

However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
