<p>Simplify your services, earn more services income, and provide a remarkable customer experience. To make sure the unit you choose is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load calculation estimate to identify the precise kind of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the same size system you currently have.

Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>
