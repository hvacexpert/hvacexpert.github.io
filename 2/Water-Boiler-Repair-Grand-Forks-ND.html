<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve.

<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Grand Forks ND</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
