<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., workplace equipment; furniture, wall and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.

Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
