<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Never Ignore in Ruidoso NM</h3>
<p>Pricing for furnace service and maintenance will differ widely from dealer to dealership, for a variety of reasons.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
