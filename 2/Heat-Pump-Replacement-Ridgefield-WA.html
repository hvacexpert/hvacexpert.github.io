<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up.
