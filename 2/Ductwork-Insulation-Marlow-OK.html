<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Contractor in Marlow</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
