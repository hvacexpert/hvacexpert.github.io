<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
