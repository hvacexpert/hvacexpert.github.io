<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior.

<p>While individuals spend 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has not been a big focus of attention for facilities management and renters until just recently.

<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor ecological quality") describes how inside air can affect an individual's ability, health, and convenience to work.

<p>There are a number of non-profit organizations that accredit indoor air quality specialists. Although DEP can not advise the services of any specific person or company, selecting an expert that has gotten the proper training and accreditation must help ensure you receive quality services. When selecting an indoor air quality expert, it is important to compare the services (and costs) of different experts, check references, etc. simply as you would for any other services or product.<p>
