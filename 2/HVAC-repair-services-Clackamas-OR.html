<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Clackamas OR 97015</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
