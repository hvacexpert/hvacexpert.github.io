Air pressure differences developed by these forces move airborne contaminants from locations of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a car radiator or typical home a/c does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it.
