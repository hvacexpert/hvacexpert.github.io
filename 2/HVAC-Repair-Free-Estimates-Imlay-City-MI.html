<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My better half stated that she had actually seen a great review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall.
