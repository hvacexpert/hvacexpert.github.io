The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

In late winter and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it's important to be knowledgeable about some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be prowling in your surroundings.<p>
