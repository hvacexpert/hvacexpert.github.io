<h3>The Way to Select An Expert HVAC Technician in Hebron KY</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
