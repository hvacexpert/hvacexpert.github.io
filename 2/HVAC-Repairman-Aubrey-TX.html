<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
