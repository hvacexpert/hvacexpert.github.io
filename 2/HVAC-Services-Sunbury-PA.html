<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
