<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness indoors is connected with a greater frequency of occupant breathing issues.<p>
<p>Because they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
