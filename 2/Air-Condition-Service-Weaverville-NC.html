<h3>Air Conditioner Repairing Service in Weaverville NC 28787</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
