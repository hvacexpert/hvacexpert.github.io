<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives typically total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout new building and construction (homes usually use in between one and five heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, brand-new installation practices are lowering expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>

<p>Consider purchasing an energy-efficient design if your air conditioner is old.

<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "general duty clause" uses. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, mentions that a company should supply a healthy and safe office. Hence, ensuring the air is of great quality is the company's duty.<p>

<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
