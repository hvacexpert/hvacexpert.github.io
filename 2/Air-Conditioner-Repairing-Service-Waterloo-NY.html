A building walk-through to check for odors and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or pest droppings may be useful. Leakages require to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with fungis or bacteria and need to be removed, likewise.
