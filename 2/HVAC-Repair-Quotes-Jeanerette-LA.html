<p>A matched system is the mix of items that comprise your HVAC system. Depending upon your area, a matched system can be composed of the following: an air conditioning system and furnace, a heatpump and furnace, a heatpump and air handler, an a/c unit and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system. By combining components that are made to work flawlessly together, you can produce a more effective ideal system.<p>
<p>As you usually need to use a self-leveling substance on top of the electric underfloor heating system, you must factor in the time it takes for this to entirely dry before the floor covering can be put in location - this is generally a day or more. The water-based underfloor heating takes longer to put in location, although this does not usually matter too much as it tends to be set up as part of a larger structure or remodelling task and installation is finished within a week typically.<p>
<p>We have been very delighted with Integrity's devices (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has worked very well and is so effective that it significantly reduced our utility costs - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergency situations they responded quickly and resolved the problem.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
