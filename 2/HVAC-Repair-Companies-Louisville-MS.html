<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outside system.

Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not basic, because it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>For example, problems arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in adequate quantities of outdoor air.

Poorly located outdoor air consumption vents can likewise generate air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
