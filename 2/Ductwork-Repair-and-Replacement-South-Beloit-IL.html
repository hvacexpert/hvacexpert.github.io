<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
