Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
