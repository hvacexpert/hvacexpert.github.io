<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Douglasville GA</h3>
<p>Radiant heat systems are increasingly popular, specifically in the previous quarter-century as innovation has actually advanced, and the systems have proven themselves in dependability and economy. Unlike convection heating, convected heat systems have no air and no ductwork flow. Glowing systems depend upon heat transfer by the infrared scientific concept used by the sun called line of sight." These invisible electro-magnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In a contained system like a home, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones up until a balance is attained.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
