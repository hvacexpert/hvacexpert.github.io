<h3>Residential HVAC in Hartsville SC 29550</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
