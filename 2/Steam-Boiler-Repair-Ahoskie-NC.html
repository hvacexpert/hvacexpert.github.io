<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the house. Toxins could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air contaminant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and germs, animal dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
