<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, considering that it is protected inside your home. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install.

Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
