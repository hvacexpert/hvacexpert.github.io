<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
