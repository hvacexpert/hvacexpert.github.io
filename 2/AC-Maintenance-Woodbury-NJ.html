One of the primary areas where clogs start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

No additional charge.<p>

<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC.
