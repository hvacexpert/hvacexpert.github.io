<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
