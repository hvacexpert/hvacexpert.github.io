If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>We needed 2 visits - Jake came out first and was really educated and enjoyable and polite. Grant came out a couple days later and was good and likewise educated to talk to.
