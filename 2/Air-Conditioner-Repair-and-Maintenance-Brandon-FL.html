<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process.

<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to opt for them for the work.
