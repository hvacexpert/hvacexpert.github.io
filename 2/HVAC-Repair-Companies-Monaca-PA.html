<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
