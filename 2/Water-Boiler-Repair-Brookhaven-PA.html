<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Brookhaven PA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
