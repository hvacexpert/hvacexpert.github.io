<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
