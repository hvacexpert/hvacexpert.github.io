<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to think about. Many times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, because the unit is combined.
