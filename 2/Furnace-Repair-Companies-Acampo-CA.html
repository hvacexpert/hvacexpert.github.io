This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same duration.
