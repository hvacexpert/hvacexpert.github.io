<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
