This company introduced a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes.

<p>Normally the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
