<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Berwick PA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
