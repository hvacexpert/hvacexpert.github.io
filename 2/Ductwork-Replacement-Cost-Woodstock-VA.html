<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare occasions.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. provided extraordinary, tailored, mindful, and quality service. His interaction style gets along, effective and engaging. He clearly and completely discussed all issues and fixes in a manner that made me confident in his capability to resolve my repair issues. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my partner and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in current memory. He also reacted to my call right away the next early morning, and coached me through a short-lived fix to a problem that could not be resolved on the first see due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and ability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
