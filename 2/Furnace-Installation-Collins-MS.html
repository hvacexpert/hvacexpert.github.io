<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
