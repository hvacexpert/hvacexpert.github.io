Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
