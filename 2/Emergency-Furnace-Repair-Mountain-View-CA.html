<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most affordable if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
