<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Though it might be hard to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are many other toxins that can not just filthy up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products add to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable organic substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video footage. They use a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs required to heat the area. The larger the space, the more effective the home heater needs to be. For already constructed home heating unit, the contractor will need to get rid of the old furnace to include the new one. These charges will be included in the installation expenses.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
