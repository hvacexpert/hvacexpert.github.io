<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>The predominant health result connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
