<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, considering that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
