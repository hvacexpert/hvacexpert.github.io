<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater due to the fact that the technicians thought they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
