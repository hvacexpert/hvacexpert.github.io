<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, electrical energy or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
