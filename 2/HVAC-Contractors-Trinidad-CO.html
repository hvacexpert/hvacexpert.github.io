<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons.

Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
