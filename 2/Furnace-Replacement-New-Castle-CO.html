<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
