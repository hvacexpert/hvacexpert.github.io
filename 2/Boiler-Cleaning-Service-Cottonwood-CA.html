<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
