<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem.

A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step.
