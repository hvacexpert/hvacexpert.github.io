The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Also, housing prices in Seattle have skyrocketed, and as an outcome, newer homes are getting taller and skinnier, with bedrooms on the upper levels.
