<h3>Ways To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System at Logansport IN</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in house building is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floorings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
