<p>I am an investor, I need to change 2 heating systems in a 8000square foot house. You can count on us to finish the job right. We deal with our 4 basic principles: integrity in everything we do, reliability and punctuality, treating everyone with dignity and supplying the best product at a reasonable cost, even using different specials from time to time. When you require it the most, do not allow your heating system or furnace to break down. We can make it work as efficiently as possible.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your house still warms to the best temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel very hot. Just be worried if your house is not warming up. However, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must call in a specialist to repair the system and inspect.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
