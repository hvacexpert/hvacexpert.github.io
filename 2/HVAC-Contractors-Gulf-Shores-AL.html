<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works however the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
