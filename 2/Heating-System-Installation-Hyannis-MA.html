<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Hyannis MA</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
