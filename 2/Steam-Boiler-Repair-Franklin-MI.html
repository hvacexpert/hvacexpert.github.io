The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, till the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production.

<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Because a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
