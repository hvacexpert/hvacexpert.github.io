<p>Because an a/c moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
