<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
