<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
