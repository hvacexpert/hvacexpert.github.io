<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate situation & decided to choose them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke to from starting to end were very expert, considerate and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>We take a look at hints prior to we provide advice to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
