<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the unit. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves checking the recommended connections as well as temperature level and pressure gauges. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and safe and secure.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common functions of environment-friendly houses as part of the growing green building movement. Green jobs represented 20 percent of all recently built houses in the U.S. last year.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole housing market.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales man comes to your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and ought to not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
