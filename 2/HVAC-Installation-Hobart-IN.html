<p>Oil heating systems tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up since the soot builds up inside the ducts, reducing their effectiveness over time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' houses.
