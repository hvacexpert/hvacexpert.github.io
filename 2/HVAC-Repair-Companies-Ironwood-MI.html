<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often build up in ductwork, limiting air flow. Since ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem really overwhelming at first, needing specialized tools, devices, and knowledge.
