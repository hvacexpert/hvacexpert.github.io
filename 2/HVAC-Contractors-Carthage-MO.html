<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a portion effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
<p>I have used all the time for 5 plus years now. I have actually signed an annual maintenance agreement which covers two services every year. Ilan has been great through all these years. Always keeps my system serviced and tuned. Haven't had any problems. Whenever he sees any concerns, he informs me about it and proactively fixes the parts. Very delighted with their service. Would suggest them anytime.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring removing and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This enables items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Area control involves moving the toxin source far from residents and even moving vulnerable occupants.<p>
<p>There is a required balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE ratings often come with higher price.

For many temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter season, having an extremely high rated heater is not always required.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne.
