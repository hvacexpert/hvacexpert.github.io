If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
