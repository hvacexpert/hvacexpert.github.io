<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>

Practically all hydronic glowing flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely versatile, will not rust and can be found in long lengths, which permit PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating unit seems less like a high-end product and more like a necessity. (Besides, warmed floorings were great enough for the Roman Empire) But before you commit to what can be a significant improvement project, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing flooring heating system is a proper solution for your specific home heating needs.<p>
