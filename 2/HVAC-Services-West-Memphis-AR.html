<p>If your a/c unit is more than 8 years old, repair is probably not worth the expenditure, unless it's a basic issue like debris clogging the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to examine not simply the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your house. Improving those components may increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than installing brand-new machinery.<p>
