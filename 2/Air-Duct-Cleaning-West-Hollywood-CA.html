<p>Instant discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are offered to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Care! Climate Pro is trusted and truly appreciated us and our situation. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and acquire it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated home once again. What's most incredible was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right prior to a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>
