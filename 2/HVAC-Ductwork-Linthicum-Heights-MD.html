<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores. The main risk of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic homes of the spore cell wall. More severe than most allergenic homes is the capability of mold to activate episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a serious breathing illness.<p>
<p>The heatpump got appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can extract heat from various sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground.

<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can accumulate and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these diseases do not show up till many years after direct exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothing and equipment brought home from task sites.<p>
