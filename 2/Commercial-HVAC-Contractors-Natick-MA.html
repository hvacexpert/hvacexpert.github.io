<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
