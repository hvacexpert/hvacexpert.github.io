<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The Fundamentals Handbook includes heating and cooling calculations. The design expert needs to seek advice from ASHRAE information for the standards of design and care as the common building codes offer little to no info on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do include much information on installation requirements, however. Other helpful referral materials include items from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heating systems are gas furnaces While oil is typically utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option in between the two types.

In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
