<h3>Heating And Cooling Services in Corrales New Mexico</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<h3>Some Useful Strategies To Follow If You Want To Update Your Central Heating Boiler in Corrales NM</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
