<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities.

For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons.

Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the system is combined.
