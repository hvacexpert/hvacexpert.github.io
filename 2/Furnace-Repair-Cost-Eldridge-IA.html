In other cases, such modifications subtly and even significantly alter buildings in ways that may be very important to their own integrity or their influence on building residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We may discover it helpful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the methods used by researchers studying communities, in order to get an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our structures.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
