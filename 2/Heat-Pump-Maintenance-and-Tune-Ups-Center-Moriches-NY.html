<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power must not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, because the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, since it considers not just the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality problems.

<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
