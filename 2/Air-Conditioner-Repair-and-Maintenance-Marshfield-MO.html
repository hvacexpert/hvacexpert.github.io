If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your car's cooling system.
