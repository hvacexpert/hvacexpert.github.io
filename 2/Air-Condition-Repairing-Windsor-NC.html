<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few reasonable ones received. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
