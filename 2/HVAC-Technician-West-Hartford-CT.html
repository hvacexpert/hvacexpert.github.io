We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
