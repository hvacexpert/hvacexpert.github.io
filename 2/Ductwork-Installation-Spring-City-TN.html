<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
