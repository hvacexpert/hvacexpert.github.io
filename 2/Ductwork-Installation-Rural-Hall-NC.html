If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on often might be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
