<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
