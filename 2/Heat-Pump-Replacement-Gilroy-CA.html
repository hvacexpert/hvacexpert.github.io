HVAC specialists suggest following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby includes lead, you may unwittingly bring lead into your home on your clothes or hands.
