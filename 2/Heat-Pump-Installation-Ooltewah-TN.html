<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Ooltewah</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the same indoor air problems as single-family homes since a number of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure products, furnishings, and home items, are similar.
