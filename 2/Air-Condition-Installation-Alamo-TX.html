<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may discover musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
