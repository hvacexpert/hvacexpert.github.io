<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
