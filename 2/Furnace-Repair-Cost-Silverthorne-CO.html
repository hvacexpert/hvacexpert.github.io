Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. However many of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their homes and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>There are numerous things to consider when attempting to determine how frequently I need to replace my air conditioning filters.

Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one cooling filter need replacing more often.<p>
