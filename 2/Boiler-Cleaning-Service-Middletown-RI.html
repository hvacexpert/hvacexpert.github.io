<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Many AC units feature a variety of unique features that can even more enhance efficiency and performance. For example, homeowners might want to try to find one that features a built-in filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular feature to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to reduce energy costs much more. Obviously, more functions suggest greater central air expenses.<p>
<p>Many companies use 3rd party guarantee companies - not YORK. YORK products are backed by some of the very best minimal service warranties in the business, including YORK's factory-backed warranty. Due to the fact that these guarantees lead the HVAC market in covering parts and key mechanical parts, you can rest assured knowing you've chosen the best furnace and a/c unit for your home or company.<p>
