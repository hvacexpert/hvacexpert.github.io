<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Air pressure differences produced by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the amount (and in some cases quality) of outside air that should be constantly supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation paired with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
