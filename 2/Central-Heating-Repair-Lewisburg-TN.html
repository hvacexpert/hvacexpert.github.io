Many common structure materials utilized before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation.

A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is frequently recommended instead.<p>
