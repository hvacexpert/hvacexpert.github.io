<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
