<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
