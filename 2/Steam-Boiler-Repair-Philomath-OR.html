<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Philomath OR</h3>

After 2 years, things started to change. There have actually been uncomfortable sounds. I got it fixed and inspected. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has actually been a great experience. Reputable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the start. But then realized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
