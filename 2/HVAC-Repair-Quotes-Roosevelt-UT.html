<p>Many well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water usually picks up lead inside the house from home pipes that is made with lead materials. The only way to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to learn how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management.

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
