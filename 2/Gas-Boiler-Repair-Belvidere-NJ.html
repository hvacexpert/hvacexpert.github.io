<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you properly size a system.<p>
