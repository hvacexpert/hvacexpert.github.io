Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective.
