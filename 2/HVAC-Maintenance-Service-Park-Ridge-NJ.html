<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Park Ridge NJ?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
