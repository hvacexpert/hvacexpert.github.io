<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
