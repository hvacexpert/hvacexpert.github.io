<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
