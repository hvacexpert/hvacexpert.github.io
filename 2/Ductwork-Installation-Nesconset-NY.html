<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
