Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
