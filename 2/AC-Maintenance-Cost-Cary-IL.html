<p>Check these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
