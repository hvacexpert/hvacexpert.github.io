<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
