<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year ago and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced reasonably, have actually managed the one repair I needed well, and are professional and constantly on-time. Have been through a few companies over the years and Wachoff's is absolutely the best I've had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been great.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
