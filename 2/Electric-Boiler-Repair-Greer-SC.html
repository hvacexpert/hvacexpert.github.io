<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Location control involves moving the contaminant source away from residents or perhaps relocating vulnerable occupants.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still does not work correctly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
