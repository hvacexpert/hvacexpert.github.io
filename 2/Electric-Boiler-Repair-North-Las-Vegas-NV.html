<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
