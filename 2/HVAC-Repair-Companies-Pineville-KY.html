<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
