<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>Consider an entire home dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old enough to validate replacement.
