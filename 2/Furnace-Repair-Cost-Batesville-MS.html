<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Current Review: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my requirements entirely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also immediately followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
