<h3>Check Out Ductwork At Kaplan LA Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require fairly little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is important to keep the system operating efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be checked for leaks, the system must be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems ought to be inspected at least two times each year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to remove dust collected in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
