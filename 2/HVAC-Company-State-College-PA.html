Air pressure differences produced by these forces move airborne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any offered opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
