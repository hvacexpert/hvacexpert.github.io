Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Franklin MA Home</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their efficiency with time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
