<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
