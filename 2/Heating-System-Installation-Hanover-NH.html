<p>Chemical toxins: Volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; wall, flooring and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled.

Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for producing power in the form of electrical energy. The 2 operations utilize various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>
