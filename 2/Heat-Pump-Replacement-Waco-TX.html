<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if essential, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>People who are allergic to these contaminants should use allergen-proof mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and avoid space furnishings that collect dust, particularly if they can not be cleaned in hot water. Because vacuuming can actually increase air-borne levels of mite allergens and other biological pollutants, allergic people should also leave the home while it is being vacuumed. Using central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high efficiency filters might also be of aid.<p>

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up.
