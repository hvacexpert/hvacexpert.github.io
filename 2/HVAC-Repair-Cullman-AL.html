<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

If keeping track of data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out.
