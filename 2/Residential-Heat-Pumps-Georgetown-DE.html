Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (homes generally utilize between one and 5 loads).

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the facilities supervisors who use our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us because of that. Usually they were initially thinking about remotely monitoring some other element of their structures, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut expenses.
