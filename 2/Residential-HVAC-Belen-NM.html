<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
