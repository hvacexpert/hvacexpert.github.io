However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
