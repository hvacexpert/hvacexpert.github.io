<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Function in Plattsburgh NY</h3>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
