<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
