<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
