<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively.

While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
