As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
