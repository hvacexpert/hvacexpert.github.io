<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipelines are rarely used due to long-lasting destructive issues.
