<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
