<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
