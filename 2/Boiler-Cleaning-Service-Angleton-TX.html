<h3>Truth About Angleton TX Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Area Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans should be set up in all bathrooms and kitchen areas. These fans eliminate humidity and carbon monoxide. The most reliable fans are resilient and quiet. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to guarantee the fans run for a sufficient period of time. A good guideline is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
