<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from procedures or products; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been revealed to minimize levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is currently no proof, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants remove substantial quantities of pollutants in homes and workplaces. Since extremely wet soil might promote the development of bacteria which can impact allergic people, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
