<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new furnaces can heat your house. Truthfully, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
