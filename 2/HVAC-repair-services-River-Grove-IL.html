<h3>What to Search for When Selecting an River Grove IL HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Considering that 1985, the Department of Real Estate and Urban Development (HUD) has permitted just making use of plywood and particleboard that comply with specified formaldehyde emission limits in the building and construction of upraised and mobile homes. In the past, some of these houses had raised levels of formaldehyde since of the large amount of high-emitting pressed wood products used in their construction and since of their relatively little interior space.<p>
