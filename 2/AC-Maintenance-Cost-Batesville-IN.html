<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
