Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure products, cigarette smoking, family items, and using unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems.

<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
