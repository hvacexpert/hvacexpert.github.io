<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
