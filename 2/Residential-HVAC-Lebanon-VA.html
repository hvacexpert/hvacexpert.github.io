<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with your home. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing.

<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They met my needs completely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing additional products. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
