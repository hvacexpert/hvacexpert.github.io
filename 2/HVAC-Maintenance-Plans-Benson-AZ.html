<p>We required 2 visits - Jake came out initially and was enjoyable and really experienced and courteous. Grant came out a couple days later and was good and likewise experienced to speak to. They both did a terrific task. Sabre's workplace personnel is really practical, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and supplying the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Certainly recommend.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
