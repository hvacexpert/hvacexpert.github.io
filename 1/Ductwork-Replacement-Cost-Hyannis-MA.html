<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has actually become a crucial problem to homeowners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution research studies have determined several contaminants that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion products, unpredictable organic substances (consisting of formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these impurities are necessary in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance.

By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can generally be done in simply a few minutes, often with no tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
