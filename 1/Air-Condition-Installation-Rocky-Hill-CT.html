<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.

When the air conditioning system works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
