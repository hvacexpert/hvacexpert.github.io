<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
