So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
