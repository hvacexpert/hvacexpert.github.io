<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
