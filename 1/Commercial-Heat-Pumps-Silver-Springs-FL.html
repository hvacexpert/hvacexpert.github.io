<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
