Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit producers usually make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c unit stops working, start by examining any fuses or breaker. Let the system cool off for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
