<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
