<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet includes the evaporator. In many split-system air conditioners, this indoor cabinet also includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump.

<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to purchase it. My partner said that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
