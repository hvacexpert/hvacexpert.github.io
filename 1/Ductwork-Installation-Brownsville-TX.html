Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can indicate considerable cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person need to be required almost any maintenance other than regular cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners must be expertly checked and changed prior to the beginning of every cooling season. However, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>
