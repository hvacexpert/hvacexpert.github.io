<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Indian Orchard MA?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
