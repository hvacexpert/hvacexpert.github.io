<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
