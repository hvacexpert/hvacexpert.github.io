<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
