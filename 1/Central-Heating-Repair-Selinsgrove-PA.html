<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores.

<p>There is a required balance in making your choice though as systems with greater AFUE scores typically come with greater price.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult job that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps people working. When a sales man concerns your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and ought to not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the options for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly.
