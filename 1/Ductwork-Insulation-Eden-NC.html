<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best option for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
