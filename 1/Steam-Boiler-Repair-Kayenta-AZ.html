However a lot of the things individuals do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and get worse asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet includes the evaporator.

Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan need to spin.

<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Since it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
