"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
