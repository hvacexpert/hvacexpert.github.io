To make sure the unit you choose is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation estimate to figure out the precise kind of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we don't simply replace it with the exact same size unit you presently have. These estimations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
