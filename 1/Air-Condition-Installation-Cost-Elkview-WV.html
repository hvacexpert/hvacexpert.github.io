<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was extremely extensive and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn supplied terrific customer care at the end of the consultation by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and effectiveness if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller wall-mounted systems, ductless divides allow you to prevent the requirement for a full duct system like a lot of other cooling systems require. You will also delight in a much more versatile system in terms of installation and cost. And because each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can say goodbye to thermostat warfare when one person would choose it a little warmer in a various room.<p>
