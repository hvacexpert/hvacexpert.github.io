<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
