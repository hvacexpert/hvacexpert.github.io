Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion goal.
