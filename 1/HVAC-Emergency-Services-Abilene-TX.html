<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Abilene TX</h3>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
