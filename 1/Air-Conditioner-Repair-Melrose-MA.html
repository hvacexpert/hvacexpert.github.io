<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Melrose</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
