<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
