<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
