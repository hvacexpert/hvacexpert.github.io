<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned up since the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their performance with time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
