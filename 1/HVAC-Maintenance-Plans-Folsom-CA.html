<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heat pump should be devoid of all obstructions and debris. Obstructions can obstruct the flow of condensed water and cause wetness build-up within the system.
