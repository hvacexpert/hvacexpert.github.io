<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
