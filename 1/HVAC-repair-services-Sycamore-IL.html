<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
