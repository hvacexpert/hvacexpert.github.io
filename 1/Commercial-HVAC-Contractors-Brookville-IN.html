Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
