<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, gas, or coal. Rather, it soaks up heat from within the earth. In addition, a geothermal heating & cooling system uses substantially less electricity compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heating system an attractive service to cut your carbon footprint, offering a positive effect on the environment.<p>
<p>In addition, house owners have a range of choices to pick from in powering a floor heating system. Glowing systems work with electrical, natural gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As lots of homeowners are all too conscious, tradition furnace systems are typically restricted to operating on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the market for that energy source turns unpredictable, rates can vary, prices increase and you can end up paying more to heat your home despite how low you set your thermostat.<p>
