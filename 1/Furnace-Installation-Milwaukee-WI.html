<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States."

<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can pay for, so many Seattleites need to discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may select to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit.
