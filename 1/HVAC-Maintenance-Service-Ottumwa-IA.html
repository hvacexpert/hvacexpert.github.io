<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
