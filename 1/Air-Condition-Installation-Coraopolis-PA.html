<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
