<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them till they have been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
