Because it tires warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow constraint will decrease the unit's performance. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>. Before choosing the installation area of a/c, a number of main factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems should not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Second of all, there must not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the space of the properties as much as possible. The outdoor unit needs to also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively released outdoors and the productivity of the whole system will drop greatly. It is extremely advisable to install the a/c systems in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>The primary factor property owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services offered.
