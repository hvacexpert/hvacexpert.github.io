<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. If your a/c unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely adding refrigerant is not an option if it leaks. A qualified technician should fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and effectiveness of your air conditioning unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the producer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German technology". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to develop a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-134a and r-404a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
