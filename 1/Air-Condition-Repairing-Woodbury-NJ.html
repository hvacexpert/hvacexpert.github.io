<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps need to also be taken to decrease pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.)

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
