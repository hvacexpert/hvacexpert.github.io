<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
