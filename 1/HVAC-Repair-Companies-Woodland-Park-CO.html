<p>Ruud a/c are a cost effective HVAC system that uses a complete lineup of heating and cooling products. The Ruud Achiever RA16 which has a 16 SEER energy efficiency would cost anywhere in between $3,500 to $3,695 to install. There's lots of testing and client reviews that credit Ruud AC units as being lasting. They likewise have available parts throughout the U.S. so their replacements & service warranties are really time effective.
