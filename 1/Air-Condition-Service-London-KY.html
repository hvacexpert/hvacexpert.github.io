<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being unclean and old.

A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your car's cooling system.

Follow the producer's directions, specifically guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heater appropriately adjusted.
