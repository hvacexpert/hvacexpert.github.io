The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of conventional hot water heater.

<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly minimizes direct exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Incorrect adjustment, frequently suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you acquire a brand-new gas stove or range. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your home. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
