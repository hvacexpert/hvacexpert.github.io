Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really happy they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
