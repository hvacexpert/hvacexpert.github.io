<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively.
