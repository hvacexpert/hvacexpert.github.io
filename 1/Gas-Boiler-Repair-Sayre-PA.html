<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it through software application. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results via a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>

This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space cooling provides optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
