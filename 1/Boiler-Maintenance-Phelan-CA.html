<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. American Requirement ac system are among the best central air conditioning brand names in business. The average cost to install a 14 SEER American Standard AC system would be around $2,600 to $3,200. The company gets far less repair requires its' AC systems than the majority of the other AC units in business.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
