<p>Structures are designed or intended to react actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and maintain surfaces to boost their longevity, efficiency, or appearance. In other cases, such modifications subtly and even significantly alter structures in ways that might be very important to their own stability or their effect on building residents through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it helpful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, particularly, some of the methods used by researchers studying environments, in order to get an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in numerous thousands of asthmatic children, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the start of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The primary health result related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
