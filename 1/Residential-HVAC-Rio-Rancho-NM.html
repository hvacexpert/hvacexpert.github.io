<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are typically not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not accomplish a performance greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have an efficiency of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Since a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>Stability Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heating systems can heat your house. Truthfully, our home heating unit is complicated, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
