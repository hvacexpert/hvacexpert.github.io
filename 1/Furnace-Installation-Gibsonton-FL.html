<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, a professional service individual must be required practically any maintenance besides regular cleaning.
