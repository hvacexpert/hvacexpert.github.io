<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold growth and need to be disposed of. Often there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in hidden or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic.

If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, possibilities are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
