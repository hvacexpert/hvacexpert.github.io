<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Some health results may show up soon after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness.
