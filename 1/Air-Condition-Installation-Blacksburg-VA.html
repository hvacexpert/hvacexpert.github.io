<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

There can be a major threat from the cumulative results of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that most people can take both to lower the threat from existing sources and to avoid brand-new problems from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to assist you decide whether to take actions that can decrease the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
