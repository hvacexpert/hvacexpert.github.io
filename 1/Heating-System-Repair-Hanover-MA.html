<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power should not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, given that the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, since it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like an area heating system) with the same quantity of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
