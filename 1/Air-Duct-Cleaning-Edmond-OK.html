<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
