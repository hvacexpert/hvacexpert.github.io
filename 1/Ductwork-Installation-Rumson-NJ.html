<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
