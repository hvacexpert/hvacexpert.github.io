<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
