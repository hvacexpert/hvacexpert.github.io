<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
