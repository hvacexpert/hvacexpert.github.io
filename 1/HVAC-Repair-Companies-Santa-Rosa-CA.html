<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses electrical energy, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can attain as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
