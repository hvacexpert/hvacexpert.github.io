<p>Great Product! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved issues. I would suggest this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.

We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses.
