<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>To establish a safe consultation or consultation with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing professionals in your area in an online search. Message or call technicians to ask whether they can perform an assessment over the phone or even over a video call. In this manner, they can examine the problem without increasing the risk of infection transmission by visiting your house.<p>
<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
