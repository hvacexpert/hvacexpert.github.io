<p>While people spend 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has not been a large focus of attention for facilities management and tenants until just recently. The coronavirus break out is bringing indoor air quality into the spotlight as medical facilities work to reduce the spread of disease and workplaces, retail, and education centers are thinking about methods to reopen securely and lessen infection.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work properly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
