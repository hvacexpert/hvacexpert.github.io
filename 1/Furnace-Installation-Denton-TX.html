<p>The main reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services provided. The cost might not be rewarding if the system is new and still under a maker's warranty. Any significant repairs should be covered under the maker's warranty. Nevertheless, some makers need routine maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, activating your new under tile flooring heating system prematurely, before the mortar has treated, can cause the grout to break or to not adhere appropriately, and may void the service warranty of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run before the compound had actually treated. If you do not follow their directions, and mortar manufacturers may refuse warranty coverage.<p>
