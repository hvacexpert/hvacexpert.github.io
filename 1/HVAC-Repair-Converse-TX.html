<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and health centers, vehicles such as cars, trains, ships, airplanes and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with regard to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might pick to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit. Nevertheless, considering current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it may be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
