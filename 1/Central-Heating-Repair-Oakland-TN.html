<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced.

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
