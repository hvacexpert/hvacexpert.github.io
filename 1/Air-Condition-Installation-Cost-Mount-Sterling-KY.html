<h3>Effective Tips for Furnace Cleaning at Mount Sterling KY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency.
