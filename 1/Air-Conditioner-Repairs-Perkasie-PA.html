<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
