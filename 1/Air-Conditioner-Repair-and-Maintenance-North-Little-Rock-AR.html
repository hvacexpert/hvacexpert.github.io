<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, people breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not toxic, but may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Micro-organisms or bacteria might also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire work environment or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
