<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
