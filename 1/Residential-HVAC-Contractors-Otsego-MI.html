<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.
