<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Woodhaven NY</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
