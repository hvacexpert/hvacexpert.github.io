Improper adjustment, often shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a brand-new gas stove or variety.

Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below.
