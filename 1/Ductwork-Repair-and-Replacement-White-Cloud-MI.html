<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Ventilation, heating and air Conditioning, and refers to the climate control systems installed in homes or commercial properties.
