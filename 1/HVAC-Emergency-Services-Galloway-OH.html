<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>I have used around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have actually signed a yearly maintenance agreement which covers two services every year. Ilan has actually been fantastic through all these years. Constantly keeps my system serviced and tuned. Have not had any issues.

<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I proceeded and purchased this Carrier and I should state it does the job quite well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool down your home which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had before. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
