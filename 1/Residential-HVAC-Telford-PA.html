Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
