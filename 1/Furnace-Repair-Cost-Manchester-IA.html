<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
