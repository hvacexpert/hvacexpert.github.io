<p>To be sincere, few of the centers managers who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us because of that. Generally they were initially thinking about from another location monitoring some other aspect of their structures, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
