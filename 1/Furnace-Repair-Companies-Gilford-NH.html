The job of an HVAC technician is fairly complicated and can vary substantially from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance task might need completely different actions and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being inspected.

By comparison, replacing a furnace and checking filter can typically be done in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
