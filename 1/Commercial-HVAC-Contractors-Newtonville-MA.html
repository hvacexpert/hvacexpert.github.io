<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain poisonous compounds (mycotoxins).

<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer should check measurements of air, temperature level and humidity flow. In addition, examination and testing of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for constructing usage and occupancy) must be carried out. A building walk-through to check for smells and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings may be helpful. Leakages require to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with bacteria or fungis and need to be eliminated, likewise. In some situations, particular testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of building tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos requires to be checked every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at Newtonville MA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
