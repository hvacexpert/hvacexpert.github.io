<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
