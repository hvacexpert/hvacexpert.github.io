<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
