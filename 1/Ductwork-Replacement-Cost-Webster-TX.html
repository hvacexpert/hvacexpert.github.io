<h3>Strategies for Quick Furnace Repair at Webster TX</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
