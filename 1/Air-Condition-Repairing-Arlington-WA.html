<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Arlington WA</h3>
<p>Sean was really handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
