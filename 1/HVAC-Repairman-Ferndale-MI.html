<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, workplaces and schools matters, particularly considering that we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the ac system will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace because it's the most common heater in Seattle houses.

If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
