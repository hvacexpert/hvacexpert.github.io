<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

And mortar makers may refuse service warranty coverage if you do not follow their directions.<p>
