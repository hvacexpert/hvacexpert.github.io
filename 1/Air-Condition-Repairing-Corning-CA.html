These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now.

He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
