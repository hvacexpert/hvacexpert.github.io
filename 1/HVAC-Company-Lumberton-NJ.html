<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
