<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in performance advantage. Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter when every 3 months. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
