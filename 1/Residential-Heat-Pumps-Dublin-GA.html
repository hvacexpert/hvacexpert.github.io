<p>The homes and structure of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground. These need to be considered prior to choosing the best design of an underground heating & cooling system. Soil with positive heat transfer properties needs fewer pipelines to achieve the desired underground heating and cooling result, while those with decreased thermal conductivity will require more pipelines.<p>
<p>We advise using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
