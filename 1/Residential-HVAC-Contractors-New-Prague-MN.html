<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common functions of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green building motion. Green tasks accounted for 20 percent of all newly constructed houses in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article anticipated that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>
