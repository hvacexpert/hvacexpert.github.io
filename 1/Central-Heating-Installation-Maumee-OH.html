<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC.
