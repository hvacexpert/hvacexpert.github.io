This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out.
