Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
