<p>Having annual maintenance performed on the furnace is a good idea if you want to conserve yourself time and cash over the long term.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
