The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
