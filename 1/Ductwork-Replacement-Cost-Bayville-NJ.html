<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heater) with the exact same quantity of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
