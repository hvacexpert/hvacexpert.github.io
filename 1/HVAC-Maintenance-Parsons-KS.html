<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
