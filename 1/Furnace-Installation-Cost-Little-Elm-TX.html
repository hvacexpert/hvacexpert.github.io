According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants.

<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature.

<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Little Elm TX</h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes far more extreme with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional kind of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heat pump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
