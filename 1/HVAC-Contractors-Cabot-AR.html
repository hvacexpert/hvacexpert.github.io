These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Oftentimes, if materials have actually stopped working to dry numerous days after the suspected water event, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not immediately noticeable.
