<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them till they have been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
