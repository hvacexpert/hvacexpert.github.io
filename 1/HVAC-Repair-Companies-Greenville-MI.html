<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a uncomplicated and effective  method to minimize ambient air pollution and prospective health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
