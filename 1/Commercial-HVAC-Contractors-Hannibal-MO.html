<p>New air conditioners generally range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER ranking means higher energy effectiveness and potentially lower energy bills. A good SEER ranking for you depends upon your house size, where you live and other factors.

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
