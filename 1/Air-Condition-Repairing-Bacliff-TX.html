<p>Professional heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC specialists suggest following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
