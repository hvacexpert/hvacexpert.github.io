<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Utilize experts and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated professionals perform better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. Because they're cheap, an ethical company does not make use of cheap labor opportunities just. Economical workmanship is generally shoddy craftsmanship, and it never helps a company develop long-lasting relationships with customers.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Occupants of homes with poor indoor air quality might suffer symptoms such as headache, eye irritation, tiredness, dry throat, sinus nausea, dizziness, and congestion. Due to the fact that many illnesses can trigger these signs, diagnosing sick building syndrome is challenging. Incredibly high levels of some contaminants, such as carbon monoxide gas, can trigger more severe disease, including death.<p>
