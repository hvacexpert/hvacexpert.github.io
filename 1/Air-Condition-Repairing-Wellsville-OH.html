<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex properly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
