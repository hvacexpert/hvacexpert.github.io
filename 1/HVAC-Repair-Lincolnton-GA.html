<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Lincolnton GA</h3>
<p>Most people know that outdoor air contamination can impact their health, but indoor air pollution can likewise have significant, damaging impact. EPA studies of human exposure to air contaminants show that indoor levels of pollutants might be two to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air pollution among the leading 5 ecological health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
