<h3>AC Maintenance in Suitland Maryland</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was kind of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>Because heating & cooling work might also require installing or repairing plumbing to supply oil or natural gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor might likewise be needed to hold a separate plumbing's license or have a licensed plumbing professional on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors particularly for this line of work. When getting a quote, be sure to ask not just if a company is certified, however likewise what type of license it holds.<p>
