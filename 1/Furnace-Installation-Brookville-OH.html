<h3>Home Furnace in Brookville OH 45309</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>These men have actually been fantastic. At a realtor, I in some cases need contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a house may cost. Recently I required to call on these guys twice.

Stability isn't just their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs totally by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pushing extra items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
