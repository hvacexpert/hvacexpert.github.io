<p>Employers are required to follow the General Responsibility Stipulation of the OSHAct, which requires them to supply employees with a safe workplace that does not have any recognized hazards that cause or are likely to trigger death or serious injury. The OSHAct likewise needs employers to comply with occupational safety and health standards developed under it. Employers ought to be reasonably knowledgeable about the possible sources of bad air quality, and they should have the resources required to acknowledge and control workplace hazards. It is likewise their responsibility to notify workers of the immediate threats that are present.Specific state and local policies may apply.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
