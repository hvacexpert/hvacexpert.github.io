Improper adjustment, often indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you purchase a brand-new gas range or variety.
