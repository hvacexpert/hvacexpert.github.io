<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
