<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
