<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the traditional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible.

If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
