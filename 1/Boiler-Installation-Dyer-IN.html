The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

These investigations exposed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe brief biking in really winter. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs put on the system due to the really low temperature levels.
