<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
