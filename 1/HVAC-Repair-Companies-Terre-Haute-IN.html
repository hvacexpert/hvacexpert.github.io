<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners.

<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
