<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Burton MI</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the air conditioning. I went on and bought this Provider and I need to say it gets the job done quite well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool off the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
