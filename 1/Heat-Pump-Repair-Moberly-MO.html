<h3>The Way to Get the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Moberly MO</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
