<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Necessary Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can suggest considerable savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>
