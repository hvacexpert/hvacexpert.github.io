<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Saint Stephen SC</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact. The majority of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll conserve cash over the long term since of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as traditional air-source units. The lack of moving parts suggests you're less most likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're substantially more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
