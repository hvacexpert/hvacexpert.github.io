<h3>Heat Ventilation And Air Conditioning in Eaton Colorado</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works however the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
