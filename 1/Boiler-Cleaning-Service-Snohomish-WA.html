<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no impurity sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stale air may also be a problem.<p>
<p>It's safe to assume that you currently have actually ductwork set up if you are changing your current air conditioning system.

This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heatpump While space air conditioning supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Snohomish WA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future.

<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are many other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable natural substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which normally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>

The building type included both commercial and residential. The majority of samples evaluated were tested positive for fungis and germs.<p>
