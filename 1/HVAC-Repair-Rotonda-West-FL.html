<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day.

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
