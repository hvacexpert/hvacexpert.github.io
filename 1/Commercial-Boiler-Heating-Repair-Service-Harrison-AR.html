Combustion items from vehicle exhaust, heating systems, hot water heater, area heating systems, aromatic candles, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not properly vented can produce carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.
