<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces at Lake Mills WI</h3>
<p>I was extremely pleased in the beginning due to the fact that things ran smoothly with no sound. Moreover, I saw noticeable changes in my electrical power bills. After 2 years, things started to change. There have been awkward sounds. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has been a good experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the beginning. But then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
