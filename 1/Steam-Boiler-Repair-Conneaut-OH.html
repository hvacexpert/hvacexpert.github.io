HVAC experts recommend following this standard guideline when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's ac system are more energy effective than designs made 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's five years old or older.
