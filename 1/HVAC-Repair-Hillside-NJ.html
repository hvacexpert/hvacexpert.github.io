Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the lack of moving parts makes them less susceptible to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
<h3>Furnace Company in Hillside New Jersey</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
