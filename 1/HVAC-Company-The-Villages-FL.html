<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.
