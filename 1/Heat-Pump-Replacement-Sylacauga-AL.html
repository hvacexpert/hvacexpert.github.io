<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same.

Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
