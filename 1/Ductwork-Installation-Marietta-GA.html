<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring surface. This is normally utilized in a second or third-floor  area and benefits from the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
