<p>If you have a big house, a home with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floors instead of the air might not suffice to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed. Property owners would be well recommended to carry out a house energy audit to evaluate where improvements might be made to increase the efficiency of an existing HVAC system. These changes might actually accumulate and possibly reduce your viewed need for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>Before setting up any brand-new heating or cooling system in a house, it is necessary to re assess and minimize the energy load of the house. A more energy effective home will not only lower the cost of a new system and utility bills, but it will greatly enhance the comfort of your house. Before we style and set up any systems, we arrange a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements. Standard improvements typically include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise several qualified home Energy Star auditors and installation specialists. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>
