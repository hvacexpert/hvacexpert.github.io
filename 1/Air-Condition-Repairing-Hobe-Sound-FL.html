<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reputable and offered source of energy.<p>
