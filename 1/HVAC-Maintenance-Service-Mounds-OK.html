<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Mounds Oklahoma</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>
