<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Roselle NJ</h3>
<p>Most people know that outside air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air pollution can also have considerable, hazardous impact. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers consistently rank indoor air pollution among the leading five ecological health risks to the general public.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
