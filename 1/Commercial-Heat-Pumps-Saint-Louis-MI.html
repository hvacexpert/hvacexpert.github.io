<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter.

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
