<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Ontario OR?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
