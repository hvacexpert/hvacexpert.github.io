<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into the house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and bacteria, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are generally smaller sized than stick-built properties and utilize substantially less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Anticipate the typical mobile home oil furnace to have starting expenses of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as many brands produce oil heating systems for this use, and you might find more options with natural gas, lp, or electric heating systems.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
