<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
