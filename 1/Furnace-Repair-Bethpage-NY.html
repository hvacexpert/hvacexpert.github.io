<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Bethpage NY</h3>
<p>Before you select a contractor, think about bids from a minimum of 3 to 5 respectable contractors. Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to guarantee that no consumer complaints have been filed which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and valid. Compare the different furnace performance scores recommended by the individual contractors to select the design and system that best suits your energy requires. Keep in mind that energy-star rated equipment will save you cash in the end but may include a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
