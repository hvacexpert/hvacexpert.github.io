<p>Improve your services, earn more services earnings, and provide an incredible customer experience. To make certain the system you pick is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation quote to identify the exact kind of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not just replace it with the very same size unit you currently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is vital so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Essentially, SEER supplies more data based upon how the EER carries out in different temps. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
