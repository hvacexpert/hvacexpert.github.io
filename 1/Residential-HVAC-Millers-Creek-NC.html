<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>
