<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Many LA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
