<p>Specific immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently tough to identify if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination.

If the signs fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort ought to be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results might be made worse by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
