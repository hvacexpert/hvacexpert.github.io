<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Production combines quality items and outstanding service with development and technological advances to provide high-performance heating and cooling products around the world. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external unit. In the outside unit of this a/c there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking numerous traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor units located in the space.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
