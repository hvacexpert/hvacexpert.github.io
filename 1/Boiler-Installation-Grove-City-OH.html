<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be serious. They include delays in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, fetuses, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>
