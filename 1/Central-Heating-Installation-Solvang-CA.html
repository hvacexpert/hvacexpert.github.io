<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced.
