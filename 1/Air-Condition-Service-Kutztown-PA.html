<p>Specific immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently challenging to identify if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place signs occur. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is away from the location, for example, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Some sources, such as building materials, home furnishings, and household products like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less continuously. Other sources, associated to activities performed in the house, release toxins intermittently. These consist of smoking cigarettes, using malfunction-ing or unvented stoves, furnaces, or area heaters, the use of solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, making use of paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and the use of cleaning products and pesticides in house cleaning. High contaminant concentrations can remain in the air for long periods after some of these activities.<p>
