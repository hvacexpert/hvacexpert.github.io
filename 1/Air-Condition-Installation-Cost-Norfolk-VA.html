However, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
