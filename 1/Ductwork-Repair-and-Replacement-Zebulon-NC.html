<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter can exacerbate issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is essential to be knowledgeable about some of the allergy and breathing triggers that may be lurking in your environments.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
