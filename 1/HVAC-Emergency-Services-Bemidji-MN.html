<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
