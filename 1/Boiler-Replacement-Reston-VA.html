<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, houses and schools matters, especially since we invest most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in extremely humid climates or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump run on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like a space heating unit) with the exact same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
