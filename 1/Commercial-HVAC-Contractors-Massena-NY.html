<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
