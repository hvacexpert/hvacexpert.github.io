<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application, it is sensible to minimize using chemical pesticides outdoors in addition to inside. Depending upon the site and bug to be managed, one or more of the following actions can be efficient: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and regular washing of indoor plants and pets. Termite damage can be lowered or prevented by making sure that wooden structure materials do not enter into direct contact with the soil and by saving firewood away from the house.
