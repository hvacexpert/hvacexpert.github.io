<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
