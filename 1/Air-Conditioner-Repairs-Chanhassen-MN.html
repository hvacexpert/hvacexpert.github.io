<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
