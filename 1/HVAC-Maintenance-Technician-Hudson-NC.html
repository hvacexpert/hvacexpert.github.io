<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
