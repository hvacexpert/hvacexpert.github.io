<p>Oil heating units are less common now than natural gas, however they can be helpful in more remote regions where energies are more difficult to access, and in colder environments since it provides more heat per BTU than other solutions. The installation cost will be lower, but energy expenses will be greater, as much as 3 times greater than gas or electric furnaces.
