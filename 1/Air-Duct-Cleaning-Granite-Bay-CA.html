<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
