<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends upon specific sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins as well.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
