<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up features when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, given that it is protected inside.
