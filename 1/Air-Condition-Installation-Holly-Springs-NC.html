<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators.

Convected heat offers heat from the floor up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
