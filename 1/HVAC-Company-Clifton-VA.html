<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than models made 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's five years old or older.
