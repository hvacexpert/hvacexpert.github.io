<p>Because the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental problems. Additionally, enhancements to the HVAC system effectiveness can also assist increase resident health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has imposed tighter constraints over the years. There are several approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>

However, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same).

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to supply adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
