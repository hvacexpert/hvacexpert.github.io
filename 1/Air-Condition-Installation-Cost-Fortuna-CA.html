<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
