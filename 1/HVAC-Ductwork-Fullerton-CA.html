<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>

And for additional support, especially for bigger a/c, consider buying a steel assistance bracket and install it to the outdoors house wall, straight listed below the windowsill.<p>
