<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo looks for more than just extra revenue or scale when it makes acquisitions - it looks for companies that can broaden Pueblo's client base or supply a new line of services.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
