<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak to your physician about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality issue is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complicated problems-- determined by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below may be proper.<p>
