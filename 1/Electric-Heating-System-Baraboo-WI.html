<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being typical features of eco-friendly houses as part of the growing green building motion.
