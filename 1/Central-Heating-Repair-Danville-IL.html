During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Various HVAC contractors might vary their service providing a little in a different way from other companies. A professional, certified and qualified HVAC technician need to be able to help with three main locations: maintenance, installation and repair. If you need to change the furnace in your home, you would definitely work with an HVAC expert to help you detach the old furnace and install the new one properly. You may also call an HVAC contractor to carry out regular maintenance on your system, or to repair malfunctioning or broken heating or cooling systems.<p>
