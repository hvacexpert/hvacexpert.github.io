<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Alto MI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
