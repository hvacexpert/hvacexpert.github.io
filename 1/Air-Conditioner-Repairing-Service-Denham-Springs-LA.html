This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.
