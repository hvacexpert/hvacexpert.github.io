<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Beaver Falls PA 15010</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
