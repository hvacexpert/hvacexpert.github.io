<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Statham Georgia</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of dealing with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly ten years and during that time, they have always provided excellent service. Everyone I have dealt with is friendly and expert. The techs are timely, polite and efficient. They make every effort to finish every job as quickly as possible and understand our financial needs on all five of the commercial residential or commercial properties on which I assist with the management.<p>

Try to find the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central units are about 15% more effective than basic designs. New residential central air conditioning conditioner requirements entered into impact on January 1, 2015; see the performance requirements for central air conditioners for details, and think about buying a system with a higher SEER than the minimum for greater cost savings.<p>
