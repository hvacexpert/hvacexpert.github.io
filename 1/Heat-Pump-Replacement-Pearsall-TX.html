<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Radiant heat provides a variety of special advantages over forced air heating unit. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.
