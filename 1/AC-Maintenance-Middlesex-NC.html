<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges employed combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Heaters are like cars and trucks. As they age, you can change one part only need another part replaced or repaired next year. It doesn't take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Furnaces incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.
