<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Jacksonville IL 62650</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered excellent customer care at the end of the visit by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we might want to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Think about a whole house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old enough to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and allowing greater comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
