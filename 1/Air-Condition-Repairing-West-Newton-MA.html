<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
