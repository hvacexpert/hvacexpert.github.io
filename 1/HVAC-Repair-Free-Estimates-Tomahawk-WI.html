<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Tomahawk WI</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently getting rid of waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it increasingly difficult for your lungs to operate correctly, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
