<p>First make sure the air filter is tidy and in great condition if you observe a decrease in heat output. Next, examine other elements of the furnace for any accumulation of dirt, dust and debris, an inexpensive repair that can help enhance efficiency. Also, inspect the vents and ducts for obstruction. Lastly, ensure the thermostat is working and positioned effectively. Attempt moving it away from direct sunshine since this may impact temperature readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature level in your home.
