<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, much of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
