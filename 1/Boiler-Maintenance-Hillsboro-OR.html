<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Hillsboro OR</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Incredibly high levels of some contaminants, such as carbon monoxide gas, can trigger more serious illness, including death.<p>
