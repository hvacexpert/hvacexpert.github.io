<p>A third method to choose whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can suggest your home might not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To discover odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
