Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance sees per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and typically some other advantages. Some companies offer top priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
