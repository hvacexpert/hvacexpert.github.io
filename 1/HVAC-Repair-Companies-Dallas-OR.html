<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (including carbon monoxide, radon, volatile natural substances ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can cause unfavorable health conditions.

<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates.

<h3>Designing Tips for Central Heating Systems at Dallas OR</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
