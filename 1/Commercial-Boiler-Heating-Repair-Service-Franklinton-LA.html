<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year.
