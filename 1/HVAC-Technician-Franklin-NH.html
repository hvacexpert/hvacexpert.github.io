<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Heat from a hydronic heating unit can make a house comfy even at lower temperature levels. You can turn the thermostat lower and conserve even more money on energy because of this. You can increase its lifespan if you run your hydronic heating system on a high-efficiency boiler at low temperature level. This saves you a lot more money in the long run. Our service technicians can further advise you on how to save as much energy as possible with a hydronic heating unit.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you prior to you know it remains in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers mild effects that are frequently mistaken for the flu. These signs include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, disorientation and nausea. The impacts of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from person to person depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
