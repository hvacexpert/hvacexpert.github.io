<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, unpredictable organic substances ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can induce negative health conditions.

Residential units can further improve indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>
<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was kind of unusual being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
