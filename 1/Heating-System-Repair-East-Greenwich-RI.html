<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
