Due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is extracted straight from the ground, it safeguards the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or pollutants.

While geothermal systems do use some electricity, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
