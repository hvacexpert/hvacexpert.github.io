<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
