<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does require to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is most likely a better service. If the existing system has actually not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that caused the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
