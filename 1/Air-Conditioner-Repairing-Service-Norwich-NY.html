<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
