The primary path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis.
