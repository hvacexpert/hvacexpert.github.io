<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
