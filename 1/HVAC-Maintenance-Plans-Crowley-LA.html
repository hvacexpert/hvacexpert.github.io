<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
