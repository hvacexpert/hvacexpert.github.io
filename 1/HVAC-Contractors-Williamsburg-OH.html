He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years ago and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
