<p>Forced air systems are the most common heater types on the marketplace, but they're not constantly the best option for every home. If you're looking for a new heating unit for your home, you need to take a look at a few of the other choices offered before picking a system that may not fit your needs best. Radiant heating, for instance, may be a better suitable for your requirements.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor.
