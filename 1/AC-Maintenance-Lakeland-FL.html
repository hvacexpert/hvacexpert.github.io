<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, given that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
