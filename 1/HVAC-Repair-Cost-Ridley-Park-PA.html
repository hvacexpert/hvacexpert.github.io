<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future.

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
