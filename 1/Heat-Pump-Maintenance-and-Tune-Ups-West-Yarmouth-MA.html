For example, we might see a window as changing somewhat gradually as it ends up being dirty, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see may be developing as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
