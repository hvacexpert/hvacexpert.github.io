<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Barberton OH</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
