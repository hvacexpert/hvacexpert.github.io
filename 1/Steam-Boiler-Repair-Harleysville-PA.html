<p>PE companies tend to run with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.

<p>Consider possible results of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, specifically directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit properly changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
