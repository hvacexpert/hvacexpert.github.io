<p>If you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your home, plan on spending numerous thousand dollars for the total system. The size of the system determines the labor hours involved to build the system. When you consider installation fees upwards of $50 per hour, to equip a house with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand new furnace or more.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as essential when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size.

Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
