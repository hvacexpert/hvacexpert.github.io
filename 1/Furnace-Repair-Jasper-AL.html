<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>
