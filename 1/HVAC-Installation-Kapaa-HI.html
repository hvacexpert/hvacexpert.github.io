<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not use agreements.  The so called credible companies rip off more people than the fly by night outfits. Since I tried to work for them, I understand. I stop because 90% of them are scoundrels. They stroll in with or without an agreement and start selling you things you don't require. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as a consultant to validate the so called issues and remedies. 9 out of 10, I check are totally wrong.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
