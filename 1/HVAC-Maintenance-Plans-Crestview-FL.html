<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Before it was understood how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not normally consist of lead. Water generally gets lead inside the house from family plumbing that is made with lead materials. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or foul-smelling air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To identify odors in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
