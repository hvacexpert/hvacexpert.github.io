<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable.

Try to keep your children from eating dirt, and make sure they wash their hands when they come inside.<p>
