<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up simply a few years back.<p>
