<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants released by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on among the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to assess situation & decided to choose them for the work.

<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, talk to your physician about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
