<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
