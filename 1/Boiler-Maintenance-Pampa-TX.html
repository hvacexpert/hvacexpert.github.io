<p>Lots of commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can also use natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outdoor air presented into a space per a system of time, and is often expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Air-Conditioning, heating and refrigerating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
