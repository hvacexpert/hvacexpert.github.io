<p>Oil heaters are typically not really efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but a lot of do not achieve a performance greater than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well since a drain needs to be set up.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities.
