<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
