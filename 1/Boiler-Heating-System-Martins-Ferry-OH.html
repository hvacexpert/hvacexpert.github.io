However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
