<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again.
