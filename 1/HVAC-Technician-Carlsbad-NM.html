<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
