<p>Expert heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results through a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to figure out.<p>
