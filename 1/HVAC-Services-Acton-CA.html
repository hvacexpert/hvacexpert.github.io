<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the increase it requires from the capacitor.

<p>Among the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is since something is filthy or clogged up Before attempting to repair any issue, require time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". Check the furnace blower for clogging and clean it if the air filter is excellent to go. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, contact an experienced technician.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that disrupts the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a series of signs from headaches, d izziness, weak point, confusion, disorientation, and queasiness, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest pain in people with persistent cardiovascular disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are often puzzled with the flu or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, infants, elderly people, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be especially sensitive to carbon monoxide direct exposures.<p>
