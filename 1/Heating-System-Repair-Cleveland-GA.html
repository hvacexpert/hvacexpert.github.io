<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer.

<p>Due to the fact that they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
