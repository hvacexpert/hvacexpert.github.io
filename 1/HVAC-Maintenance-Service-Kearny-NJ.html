<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
