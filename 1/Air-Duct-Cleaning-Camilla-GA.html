<p>Most people know that outside air contamination can impact their health, but indoor air pollution can likewise have substantial, hazardous effect. EPA research studies of human exposure to air toxins show that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination among the leading five ecological health risks to the public.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
