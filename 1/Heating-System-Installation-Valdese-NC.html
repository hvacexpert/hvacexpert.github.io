<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in Valdese NC 28690</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
