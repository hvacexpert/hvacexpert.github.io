<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
