<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
