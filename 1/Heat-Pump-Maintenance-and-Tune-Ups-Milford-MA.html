<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
