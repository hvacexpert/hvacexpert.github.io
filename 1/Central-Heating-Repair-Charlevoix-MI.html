<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Charlevoix Michigan</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and overheat down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Turn off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work effectively after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor begins however the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you have actually offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
