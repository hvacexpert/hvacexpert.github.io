<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Coloma MI</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home building and construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in floors, roofs, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
