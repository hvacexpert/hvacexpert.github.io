<p>Similar to many house improvement jobs, the cost of a full central heating system can vary extensively based on the size of the house. Many heaters will last between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, property owners must consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
