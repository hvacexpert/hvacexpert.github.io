They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
