<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it since it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow constraint will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>. Before picking the installation place of air conditioner, numerous main aspects need to be thought about. First off, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems need to not fall on the location of rest or work area. Second of all, there ought to not be any challenges on the way of the air flow that may avoid it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor system should likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently discharged outside and the performance of the whole system will drop greatly. It is highly recommended to set up the a/c systems in quickly available locations, for more maintenance during operation.<p>
