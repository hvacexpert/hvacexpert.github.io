<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
