The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the main issue in over half the office indoor air examinations it has conducted. Investigations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true. These examinations revealed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
