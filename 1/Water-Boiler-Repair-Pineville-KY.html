The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
