Not just will obstructed vents and registers impact your comfort, they can also result in duct leakages due to excessive atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
