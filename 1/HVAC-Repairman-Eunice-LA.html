<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators.

Convected heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
