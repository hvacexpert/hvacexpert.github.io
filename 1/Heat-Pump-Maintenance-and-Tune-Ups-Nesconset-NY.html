<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
