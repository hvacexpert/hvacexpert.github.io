Heat can be gotten rid of through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as refrigerants A refrigerant is employed either in a heatpump system in which a compressor is utilized to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a totally free cooling system which utilizes pumps to distribute a cool refrigerant (usually water or a glycol mix).<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
