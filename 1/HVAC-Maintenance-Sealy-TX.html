<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next step is to defrost your a/c equipment. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
