<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
