<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, because it takes into account not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
