<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider. Often times, these units include not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
