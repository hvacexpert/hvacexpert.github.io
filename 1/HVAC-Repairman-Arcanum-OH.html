<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
