<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be allowed to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to comprehend and maintain.<p>
