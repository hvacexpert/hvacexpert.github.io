<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
