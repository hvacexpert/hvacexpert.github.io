<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
