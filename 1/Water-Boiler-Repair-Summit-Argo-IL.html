He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have fulfilled in a long time.

<h3>Central Heating Boilers in Summit Argo IL 60501</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He assisted me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
