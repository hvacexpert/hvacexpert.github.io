<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
