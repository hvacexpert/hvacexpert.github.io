<p>As kept in mind, inappropriate temperature and humidity levels, and too little or excessive air circulation might also contribute to worker health problems. Temperature level levels ought to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air flow ought to be avoided.

<p>Equipment costs are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, however result in greater energy expenses. High-efficiency models cost more, but conserve more over the long run. Rates for gas heating systems vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric heaters begin at $395 and vary up to $1,700 or more depending upon the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These products present a risk only when they are managed in such a way that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or interrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in location. This can result in the capacity for substantial illness.<p>
