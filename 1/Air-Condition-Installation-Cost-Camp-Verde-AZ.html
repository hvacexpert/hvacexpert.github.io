<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor home appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
