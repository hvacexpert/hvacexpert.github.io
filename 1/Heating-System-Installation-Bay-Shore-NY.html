<p>Sean was very useful. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>All heating unit have some level of air purification. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance.
