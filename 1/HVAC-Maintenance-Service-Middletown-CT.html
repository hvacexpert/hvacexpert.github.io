After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
