<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
