<h3>Water Boiler Repair in Westerly Rhode Island</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95).

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature level of the floor.
