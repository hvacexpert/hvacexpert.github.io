<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to supply enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
