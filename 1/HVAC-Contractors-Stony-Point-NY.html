<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program.

There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
