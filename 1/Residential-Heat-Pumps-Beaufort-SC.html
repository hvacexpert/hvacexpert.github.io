<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Beaufort South Carolina</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>When installing radiant heat, you need to give major idea to the type of flooring covering in the house. Due to the fact that it performs and shops heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, however work reasonably well. Carpets will straight insulate the flooring from the room, reducing performance, so if you wish to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with dense padding.<p>

<p>These men have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I needed to call on these guys two times. They came out rapidly and offered me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Stability isn't just their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
