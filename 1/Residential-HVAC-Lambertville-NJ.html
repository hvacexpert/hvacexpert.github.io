<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your physician about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
