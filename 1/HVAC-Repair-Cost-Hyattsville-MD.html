<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
