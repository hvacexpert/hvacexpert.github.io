<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping machine to circulate warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the flooring heat transferred heat to other short articles in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>The first a/c and fridges used harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
