Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.

<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
