<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in South Ozone Park NY</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
