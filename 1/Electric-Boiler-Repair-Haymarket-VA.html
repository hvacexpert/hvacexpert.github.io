<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product.
