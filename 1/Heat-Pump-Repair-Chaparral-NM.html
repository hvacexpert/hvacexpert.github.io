<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check.
