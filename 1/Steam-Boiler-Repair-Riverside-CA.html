<h3>AC Technician in Riverside CA 92503</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Installing a/c costs in between $3,350 and $5,912 with most homeowners reporting spending $4,631 typically. This rate is typical of setting up a new AC system to your forced air furnace. Other choices include single window systems or portable systems for $234 to $700 or ductless mini divides for $660 to $4,500. Your overall cost depends on the type and size of cooling system you require.<p>
