Many typical structure materials utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Due to the fact that the fibers can be spread into the air throughout the removal procedure, elimination of asbestos-containing products is not always optimum. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is frequently recommended instead.<p>
