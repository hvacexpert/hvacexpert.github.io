<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
