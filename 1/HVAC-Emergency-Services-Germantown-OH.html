<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your company needs to inspect measurements of humidity, air and temperature level flow.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
