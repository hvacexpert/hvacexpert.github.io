<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Kittanning Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

Checking for many toxins can be pricey. Before monitoring your home for contaminants besides radon, consult your state or local health department or specialists who have experience in fixing indoor air quality issues in nonindustrial buildings.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
