<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just glowing systems.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
