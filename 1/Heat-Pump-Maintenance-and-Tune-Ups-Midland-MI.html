<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
