<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

To discover odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>
