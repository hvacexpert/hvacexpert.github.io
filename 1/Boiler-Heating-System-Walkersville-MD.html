<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
