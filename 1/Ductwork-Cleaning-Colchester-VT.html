While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
