<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the outcome of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too little or excessive air circulation. Office temperatures need to be maintained between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air flow must be prevented.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
