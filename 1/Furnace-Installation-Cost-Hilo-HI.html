<p>These concepts-- and willingness to suffer through the heat-- may already be altering. Though just 33 percent of Seattle housing systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new housing units have been integrated in the 4 years because or are currently under building. The huge bulk of these units are mixed-use or multi-family, where air conditioning is more of an industry requirement, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists used different approaches. The CMHC research study contacted numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a study, and the scientists did not control for time invested or techniques used. The EPA study prescribed and managed methods used on a smaller sized variety of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both research studies have defects, no other research has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches utilized by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered given that these research studies were carried out, the duct in homes have not.<p>

<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

<p>The steadiness of the market's growth doesn't always equate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The air, heating and ventilation conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. Demand heats up during the summer season and winter season when consumers require their HVAC systems repaired for relief against the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather gets here.<p>
