<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, speak to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
