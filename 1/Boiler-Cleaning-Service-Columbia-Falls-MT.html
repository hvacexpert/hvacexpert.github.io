<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being dirty and old. The old coolant will adversely impact the system's efficiency. To make certain the system is working efficiently, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>My eldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Residents of homes with poor indoor air quality may suffer symptoms such as headache, eye irritation, tiredness, dry throat, sinus lightheadedness, nausea, and blockage.
