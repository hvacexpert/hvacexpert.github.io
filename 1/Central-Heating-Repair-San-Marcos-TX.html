<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Company in San Marcos</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
