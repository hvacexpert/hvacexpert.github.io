Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
