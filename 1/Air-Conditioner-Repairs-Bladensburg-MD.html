<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the ac system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioning system won't be able to cool the house correctly.

On the other hand, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a vicious, harsh summer.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the existing one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
