<p>Stability Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heating systems and make them work.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
