<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
