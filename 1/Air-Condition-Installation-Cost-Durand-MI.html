<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
