<p>The very first a/c unit and fridges used harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

Standard enhancements generally include adding insulation and air sealing procedures.
