<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have been effectively dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, however not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
