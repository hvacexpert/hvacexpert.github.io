<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality issues are not limited to houses. In fact, lots of office buildings have significant air pollution sources Some of these structures might be improperly aerated.
