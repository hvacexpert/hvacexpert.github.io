A key part of the program is responding to and dealing with issues of building residents about problems in their workplace.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts may appear after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are treatable and typically short-term. Sometimes the treatment is merely eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear soon after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
