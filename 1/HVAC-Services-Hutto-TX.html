<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
