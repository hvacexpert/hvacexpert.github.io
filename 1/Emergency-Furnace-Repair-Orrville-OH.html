<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group excels in including a multidisciplinary technique to indoor air quality (IAQ) difficulties.

<p>There are numerous actions a property owner can take to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from occurring - a number of them are mentioned here. Initially, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, think about utilizing solid wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that an effective moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>

<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stagnant air might also be a problem when ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location.<p>
<p>The response to the concern, What does an HVAC technician do?, will differ somewhat depending upon industry of employment, position, and specialized.

They help keep us comfy - and healthy!
