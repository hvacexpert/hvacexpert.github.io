<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Fuquay Varina NC?</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<h3>Home Furnace in Fuquay Varina NC 27526</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
