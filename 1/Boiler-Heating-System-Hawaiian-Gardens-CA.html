<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
