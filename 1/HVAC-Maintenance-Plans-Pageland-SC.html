<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this.

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ may see undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, speak with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-lived indoor air quality issue is produced just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated issues-- determined by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the three tactics listed below might be proper.<p>
