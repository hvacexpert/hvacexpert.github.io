<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
