<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.

<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might observe moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues.

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
