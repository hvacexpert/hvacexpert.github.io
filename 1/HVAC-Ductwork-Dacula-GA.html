<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The key portion of your a/c is the outside system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its positioning on your residential or commercial property and its upkeep, it may sustain some damage during the winter season. The majority of the time, this just consists of some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is pretty simple to get rid of. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the unit and make sure that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or excessive wear to the outside. They may advise that you trim overgrown trees or bushes to make sure sufficient air flow around the unit.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio.

<p>Outside contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
