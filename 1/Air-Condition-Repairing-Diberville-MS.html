<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Diberville MS</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
