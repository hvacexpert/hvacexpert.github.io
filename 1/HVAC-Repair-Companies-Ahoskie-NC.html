<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
