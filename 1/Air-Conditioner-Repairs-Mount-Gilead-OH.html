<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
