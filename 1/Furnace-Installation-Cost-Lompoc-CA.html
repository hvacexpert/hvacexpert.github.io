If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil.

If you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to thaw your a/c equipment. The most convenient way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
