<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

<p>Since they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler.

Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
