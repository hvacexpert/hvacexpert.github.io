<p>While contaminant levels from individual sources might not posture a considerable health danger by themselves, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that most people can take both to decrease the danger from existing sources and to prevent new issues from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can reduce the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
