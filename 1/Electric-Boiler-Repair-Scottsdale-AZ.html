<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, merely including refrigerant is not an option. A skilled technician must repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
