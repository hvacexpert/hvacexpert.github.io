<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the tools or abilities necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant resulting from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are typically higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
