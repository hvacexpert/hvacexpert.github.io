<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in O Fallon MO</h3>
<p>Among the main factors a furnace will run continuously is since something is clogged or unclean Prior to attempting to fix any issue, take time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". Inspect the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it if the air filter is excellent to go. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, contact an experienced technician.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
