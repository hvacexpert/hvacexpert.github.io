<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
