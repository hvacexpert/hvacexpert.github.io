<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>The predominant health result connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
