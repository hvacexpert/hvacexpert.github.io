Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.
