<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating system, you may search for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
