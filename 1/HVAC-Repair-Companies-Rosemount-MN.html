<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to your home for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have handled the one repair I required well, and are expert and always on-time.

Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time.
