<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
