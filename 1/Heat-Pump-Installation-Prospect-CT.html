<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater.

If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
