<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioner back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
