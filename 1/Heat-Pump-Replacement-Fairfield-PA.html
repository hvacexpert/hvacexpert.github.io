<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Fairfield PA</h3>
<p>Sean was very valuable. He is a very pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
