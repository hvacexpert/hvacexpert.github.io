<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Alvarado Texas</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They advised changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very happy they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>

Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers.
