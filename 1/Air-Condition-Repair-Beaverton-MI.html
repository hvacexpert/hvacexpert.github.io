It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
