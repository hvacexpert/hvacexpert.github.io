<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is developed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building products, smoking cigarettes, family items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in manufactured products. For example, it is utilized to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing items.<p>

If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it through software application. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to decipher.<p>
