<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
