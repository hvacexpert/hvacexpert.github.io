<p>In-floor heater can include particular health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you just can't seem to warm up and find you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. Since they heat surfaces and not the air itself, in-floor heater are not susceptible to this issue. Furthermore, given that they do not trust fans, ducts, registers and returns to disperse hot air, in-floor heating systems can reduce the amount of dust and seasonal irritants in your home.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the specialists believed they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
