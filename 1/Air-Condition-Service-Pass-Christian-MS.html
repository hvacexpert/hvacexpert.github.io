<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may see moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
