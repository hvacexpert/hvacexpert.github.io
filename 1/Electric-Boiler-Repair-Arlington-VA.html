<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home.

It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
