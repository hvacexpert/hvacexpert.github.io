<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is committed to providing a work environment that is devoid of acknowledged risks and to examination problems that may be associated with poor indoor air quality (IAQ).
