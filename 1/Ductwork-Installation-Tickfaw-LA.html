<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
