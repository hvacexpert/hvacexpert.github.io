<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions.

Gas heating systems cost about the exact same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home.
