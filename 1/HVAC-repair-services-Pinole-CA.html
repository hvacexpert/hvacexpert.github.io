<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
