The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements.
