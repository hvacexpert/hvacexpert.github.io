The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
