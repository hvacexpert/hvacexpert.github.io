<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
