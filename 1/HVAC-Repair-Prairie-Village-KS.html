<h2>How To Hire HVAC Company in Prairie Village</h2>

<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
