<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
