The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
