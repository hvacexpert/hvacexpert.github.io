<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
