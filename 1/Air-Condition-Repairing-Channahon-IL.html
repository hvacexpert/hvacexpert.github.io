<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
