<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
