<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
