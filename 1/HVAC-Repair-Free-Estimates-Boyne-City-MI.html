But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
