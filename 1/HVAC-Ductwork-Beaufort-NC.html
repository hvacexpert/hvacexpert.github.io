<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Beaufort NC Home</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons a furnace will run constantly is because something is filthy or stopped up Before trying to repair any issue, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is great to go, examine the furnace blower for blocking and tidy it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. Get in touch with an experienced technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
