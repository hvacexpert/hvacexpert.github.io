<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues.
