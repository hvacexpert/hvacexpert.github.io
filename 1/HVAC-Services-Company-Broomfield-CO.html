<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
