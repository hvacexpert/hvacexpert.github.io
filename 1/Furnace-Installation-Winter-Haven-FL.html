<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, eye, and throat irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort.

<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
