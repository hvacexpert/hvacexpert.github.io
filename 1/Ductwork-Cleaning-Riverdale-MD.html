AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two.

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with the house.
