<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow constraint will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
