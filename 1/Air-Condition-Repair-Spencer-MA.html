The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
