<p>UW staff members, students and visitors should have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform numerous activities. If the air quality is poor it can impact a person's health, convenience, and performance.  The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and maintain comfortable and healthy environments devoid of pollutants. A key part of the program is reacting to and solving issues of structure residents about issues in their work environment.<p>
<p>. Before picking the installation area of a/c, numerous main aspects need to be thought about. First off, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems need to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there must not be any obstacles en route of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outside system must also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be successfully discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop dramatically. It is extremely a good idea to install the air conditioning unit systems in quickly accessible places, for additional maintenance throughout operation.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
