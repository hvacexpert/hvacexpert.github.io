<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
