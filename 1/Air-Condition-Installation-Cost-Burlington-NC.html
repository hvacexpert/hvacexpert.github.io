<p>These guys have actually been excellent. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to offer me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost.

Even when it was news my client most likely would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>
