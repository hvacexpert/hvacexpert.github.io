<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
