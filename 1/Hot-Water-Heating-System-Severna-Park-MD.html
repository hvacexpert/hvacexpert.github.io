This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
