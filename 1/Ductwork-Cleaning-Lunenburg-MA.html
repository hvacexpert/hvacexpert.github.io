<p>In addition, employee health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be induced as the outcome of temperature level extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air flow.

<p>Typically the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions.
