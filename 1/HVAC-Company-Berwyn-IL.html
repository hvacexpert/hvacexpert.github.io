<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Berwyn Illinois</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Some health effects might show up soon after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a pollutant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are typically short-term and treatable.

Soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be aggravated or intensified.<p>
