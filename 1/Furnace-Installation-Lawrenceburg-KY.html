Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of a system needed based on BTUs, determining the correct size of unit for your home likewise depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
