<h3>Electric Furnace in Rantoul Illinois</h3>
<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry. Also, if the ac system smells bad, there might be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil absorbs the heat far from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Radiant heating involves installing coils or pipes in the flooring, providing heat from below and moving up. It presents an even, overall heat temperature throughout the space. Without any moving parts, it's comfortable and extremely quiet, and it does not stir up as much dust and allergens, as compared to forced-air systems. It also does not develop any drafts, and eliminating the need to blow air makes it more energy effective.<p>
