<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>Remember, too, that you may want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and performance if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
