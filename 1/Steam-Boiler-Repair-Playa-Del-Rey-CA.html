<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
