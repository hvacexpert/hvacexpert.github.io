<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a solution.

So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
