<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
