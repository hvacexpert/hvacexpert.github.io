<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be puzzled.

The two operations use different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
