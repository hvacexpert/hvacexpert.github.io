<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might discover musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
