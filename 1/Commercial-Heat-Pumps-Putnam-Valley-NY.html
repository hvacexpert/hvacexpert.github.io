<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
