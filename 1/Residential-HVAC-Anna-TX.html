<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
