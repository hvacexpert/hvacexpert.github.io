If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
