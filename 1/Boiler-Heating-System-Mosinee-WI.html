<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
