<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for bids. While both were useful and practical, Ballard Gas provided us a better offer, for exceptional service.

He consisted of these minor however substantial changes in his bid. Because of current warmer summer seasons and for environmental reasons, we chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that ought to be continually supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
