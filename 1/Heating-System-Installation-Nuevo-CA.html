<p>The exhaust outlets enable all unsafe gases to leave your property so there's no risky accumulation of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are blocked, they can lead to an unsafe accumulation and jeopardize your safety. The technician will evaluate all of these elements of your system and examine the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will try to find indications of rust, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
