<p>Specific immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to identify if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is necessary to take notice of the time and place signs occur. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the area, for instance, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
