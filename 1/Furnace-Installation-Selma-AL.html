<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But many of the things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their houses and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>A Trane air conditioning unit can range in rate from $4,000 - $10,000. Our rates guide describes all the aspects that impact your price.
