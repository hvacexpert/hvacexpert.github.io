<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
