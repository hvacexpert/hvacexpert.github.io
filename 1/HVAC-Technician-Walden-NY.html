<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>When you and your household walk into your house in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be? Do you find it to be either too cold throughout the winter season or too warm in locations throughout the summer season?

<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect modification, typically shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you buy a new gas stove or variety. Never ever use a gas range to heat your house. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
