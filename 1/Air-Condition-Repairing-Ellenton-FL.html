<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard.

DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
