<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have actually dealt with the one repair I needed well, and are constantly on-time and professional. Have actually been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is certainly the very best I have actually had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been fantastic.<p>
<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior.
