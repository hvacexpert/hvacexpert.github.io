<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, because it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95).

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
