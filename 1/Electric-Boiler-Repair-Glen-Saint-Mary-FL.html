<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
