<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>We take a look at clues before we provide guidance to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
