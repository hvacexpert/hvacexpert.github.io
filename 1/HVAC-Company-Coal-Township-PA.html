<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They include hold-ups in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Children may have higher exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
