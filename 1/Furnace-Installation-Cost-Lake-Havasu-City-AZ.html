<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
